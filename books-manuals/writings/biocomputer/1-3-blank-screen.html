        <h2>The Blank Screen</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The external reality screens for the projection of the display
            program in the LSD state thus can be arranged in a set with various
            dimensions relating each to the others. Among these are: the
            nonselfreal persons; motion pictures of these persons in various
            states; still pictures of the persons; pictures of self from the
            past, motion and still, three dimensional and flat; the here-andnow
            threedimensional color image of one's face and/or body in a mirror;
            and finally, the eyesopen or eyesclosed blank unlighted or lighted
            <em>projection screen.</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The blank projection screen introspectively considered varies
            depending upon whether the eyes are open or closed. In the dark, in
            the absolute dark, one can detect differences between the eyes open
            and the eyes closed blank screen. The eyes open case gives a feeling
            of depth out beyond the eyes, a feeling of areal visual space. In
            this subject the eyes closed immediately turns the vision to a
            different visual space which seems more internal, more
            introspective, more subjective. In the LSD<sub>25</sub> state these
            differences are attenuated in the profound isolation conditions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The blank screen is the most difficult one to work with but is the
            least "driving" of the group.
            <strong
                >The blank screen interferes least with one's creative
                efforts;</strong
            >
            it takes more program circuitry to create those aspects which can be
            furnished by the other screens themselves, from the perception
            mechanisms directly into the projection program itself. The blank
            screen does not so easily show the "forbidden transitions" except by
            remaining blank, i.e., more relaxation and freedom to "free
            associate" with this visual mode is required to project on a blank
            screen.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            At times the crossmodel synesthetic projection may help with the
            blank screen; excitation coming in the objective hearing mechanisms
            can be converted to excite visual projection. The commonest
            excitation used here is music; this wellorganized patterned input
            tends to "drive the content by association." For instance, religious
            music can evoke religious visions constructed in childhood from real
            pictures, churches and phantasies, etc. Other inputs are voices,
            one's own real or recorded voice, the voice of another person these
            sources can have problems similar to those with the pictures. The
            high priority program we are calling the external reality program
            may tend to usurp the circuitry and take over from the projection
            program with pictures or voices of known and valued persons. This
            effect interrupts the projection and its free association. In the
            long run the external reality's content and its connections can be
            shown to be relevant by continued selfanalysis, using the usual
            techniques of psychoanalysis.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Such interruptions depend upon the individual computer and its
            conflicts in relation to the projection program versus the external
            reality program. If there is guilt or fear present, the external
            sources will attract the energy of the computer back to the
            <em>external reality.</em> Alternatively, if the level of excitation
            from the person in the external reality rises above a certain value,
            the whole computer will be turned to that particular person and
            his/her vocal output and his/her behaviors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Purely random noise may avoid these difficulties; it may be a proper
            <em>acoustically lighted blank screen</em> for crossmodel excitation
            of the visual projections. Initial experiments with inphase and
            nonphase noise in the two ears show some new programming
            possibilities. One pitfall, here, however, is to avoid the initial
            problem of the programming by the random processes of the noise
            itself. This tends to result in chaotic programming, i.e.,
            randomness itself can build up to a large intensity within the
            metaprogramming systems. With adjustment of the acoustic intensity
            of the two nonphase related noises these effects can be attenuated
            and the noisily lighted visual screen used for proper projection
            purposes. Only preliminary experiments have been done in this region
            as yet.
