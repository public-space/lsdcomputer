        <h2>Personal Metaprogrammatic Language</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>An Example of Its Properties</p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Among all of the languages possessed by one's self some are used to
            control the metaprogrammatic level in Fig. 1. The
            self-metaprogrammer exerts control through
            <strong>the personal metaprogrammatic language.</strong> This is the
            language which controls the computer itself, how it operates, and
            how it computes as an integral whole.
            <strong
                >Each human computer has a unique private control language in
                its unique stored programs, stored metaprograms, and stored
                selfmetaprograms.</strong
            >
            This language is not all shared in the usual public domain of the
            language acquired in childhood.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In this particular instance one can visualize in Fig. 1 certain
            levels in and at which the experiments were done in detail. This
            <strong
                >control language and control of the biocomputer itself can be
                changed as new understanding of control allows new
                control.</strong
            >
            This language has aspects which are nonverbal, nonvocal and can be
            more emotional and/or mathematical than they are linguistic. Here we
            are expressing some "linguistic" aspects and some of the
            'mathematical" nonverbal experiences. We are limited in this public
            expression to the consensus nonprivate language.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The experiments were designed along the lines of finding solutions
            to certain personal problems within the biocomputer. These Problems
            are the basic ones of the Presence of antithetical and contradictory
            metaprograms. In Fig. 1 some of these paradoxical and agonistic
            problems appear at the supraselfmetaprogram level and some at the
            metaprogram level. One such experiment was on a spontaneous
            occurrence of a phrase (during the LSD<sub>25</sub> state) which
            took on elements of humor and the aspect
            <em>as if a great discovery.</em>
            The private metaprogrammatic control instruction is
            <em>the key is no key.</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the external reality, stimulus for this statement was a number of
            keys which the subject had been carrying around for several years.
            He suddenly became aware that he had in his life many locks. Thus it
            was necessary for him to carry many keys. At times these keys were
            felt as a physical and a mental burden which slowed the efficient
            operation of his life. These were aspects of the phrase
            <em>key</em> which were real keys, real locks on real doors to real
            rooms, real houses, real offices, etc. At that particular moment
            this seemed to be the epitome of modern civilization: to have doors,
            to have locks on those doors, and have privileged persons who
            possessed the keys to open those doors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The subject next moved from the meanings in the
            <em>external reality metaprogram</em> to another level in which he
            inter- nalized this picture of the door, the room, the lock, the
            key. He visualized his own antithetical metaprograms as existing in
            rooms separated by doors which had locks on them. He was searching
            for the keys to open the doors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As these inner <em>rooms</em> (categories, problems, antitheses)
            became embodied in the <em>locked door</em> imaginedprojected
            metaphor the subject began to walk through metaprogrammatic storage
            looking for a key to open the next door into the further recesses of
            the rooms. As he moved he began to see that the doors were defined
            as doors by his own computer; locks were defined as locks; and that
            keys were defined as necessary to open the locks.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In a moment of insight, he saw that the defined boundaries (the
            doors, the walls, ceilings, the floors, and the locks themselves and
            their keys) were a convenient metaprogram dividing up his knowledge
            and his control mechanisms into compartments in an
            <em>artificial personal</em> fashion.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            He explored many rooms with many different kinds of knowledge in the
            rooms. The walls slowly began to dissolve, some of them melted and
            flowed away; other rooms were revealed as solid and the doors with
            secure locks rather numerous; some keys were missing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Most of the hypothesized <em>building</em> inside his own mind,
            however, now became open spaces with information freely available
            without the former walls between arbitrary
            <em>rooms of categories.</em>
            Those rooms, locks, and keys that were left were quite basic to the
            development of this individual's selfmetaprogram.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Some of these <em>rooms</em> were created in childhood in response
            to situations over which the selfmetaprogrammer had no control.
            These rooms housed ideas and systems of thinking which to this
            particular subject evoked intense fear or intense anger as he
            approached with the intent of opening the doors. The locks did not
            respond to frontal assaults. These rooms turned out to be very
            difficult to define out of existence in order to have their contents
            interact with the rest of the metaprogrammatic level.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The subject underwent a frantic and frightened search for the keys
            to the locks of these <em>strongrooms.</em> He became alternately
            fearful and angry. He made several assaults on walls, doors,
            ceilings and floors of these closed rooms without much success.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            He went away from these rooms into
            <em>other universes and other spaces</em>
            and left the computer to work out solutions below his levels of
            awareness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Later with higher motivational energy the subject returned to the
            problem of the lock, the doors and the rooms somewhat refreshed by
            the experiences in the other realms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            <strong><em>Mathematical transformations</em></strong> were next
            tried in the approach to the locked rooms. The concept of the key
            fitting into the lock and the necessity of finding the key were
            abandoned and the rooms were approached as
            <strong><em></em>topological puzzles.</strong> In the
            multi-dimensional cognitional and visual space the rooms were now
            manipulated without the necessity of the key in the lock.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Using the transitional concept that the lock is a hole in the door
            through which one can exert an effort for a topological
            transformation, one could turn the room into another topological
            form other than a closed box. The room in effect was turned inside
            out through the hole, through the lock leaving the contents outside
            and the room now a collapsed balloon placed farther from the
            selfmetaprogrammer. Room after room was thus defined as turned
            inside out with the contents spewed forth for use by the
            selfmetaprogrammer. Once this control <em>key</em> worked, it
            continued automatically to its own limits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            With this sort of an "intellectual crutch," as it were, entire new
            areas of basic beliefs were entered upon. Most of the rooms which
            before had appeared as strong rooms with big powerful walls, doors,
            and locks now ended up as empty balloons. The greatly defended
            contents of the rooms in many cases turned out to be relatively
            trivial programs and episodes from childhood which had been
            overgeneralized and overvalued by this particular human computer.
            The <strong>devaluation</strong> of the general purpose properties
            of the human biocomputer was one such room. In childhood the many
            episodes which led to the selfmetaprogrammer not remaining general
            purpose but becoming more and more limited and
            <em>specialized</em> were entered upon. Several layers of the
            supraselfmetaprograms laid down in childhood were opened up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The mathematical operation which took place in the computer was the
            movement of energies and masses of data from the
            supraselfmetaprogram down to the selfmetaprogrammatic level and
            below. At the same time there was the knowledge that programmatic
            materials had been moved from the <em>supraselfposition</em> to the
            <em>underselfcontrolled position</em> at the programmatic level.
            These operations were all filed in metaprogram storage under the
            title "The key is no key." It was noticed that the necessity for
            locks and for keys in the real world had to be dealt with. There was
            an interval of time in which the subject was quite willing to throw
            all of his keys away and keep all of the real doors of his life
            unlocked. That was tried briefly and resulted in a theft. This
            immediately brought home the obvious fact that the external reality
            programs cannot be controlled by the selfmetaprogram. There are
            other human biocomputers and a real external reality which has
            unpredictable properties not under the control of the
            selfmetaprogrammer. Therefore there must remain in the
            supraselfmetaprogram certain rules for conduct of the human computer
            in the external reality. There must remain a certain modicum of real
            supraself control and respect for the external reality's part of the
            supraselfmetaprogram .
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As it was stated elsewhere (Lilly, 1956, Lilly and Shurley, 1960):
            <em
                >the province of the mind is the only area of science in which
                what one believes to be
                <strong>true either is true or becomes true</strong> within
                limits to be determined experimentally.</em
            >
            This particular subject saw that <em>the key is no key</em> is a
            private selfmetaprogramming language phrase and should not be
            applied to the external reality metaprogram nor should it be applied
            to other human biocomputers (at least without careful consideration
            of their capabilities and their own supraselfmetaprograms). As it
            were similar topological transformations under control of the
            self-metaprogrammer may not yet have developed within the given
            other person. The kinds of phenomena expressed by this unique
            private human computer <em>(The key is no key)</em> may be totally
            inapplicable to others.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Metatheoretically considered, however, the above operation can be
            reexpressed by a given individual and elaborated and differentiated
            along other coordinates. For those willing to try these experiments
            I wish to add a suggestion: It is necessary to explore all aspects
            of one's body image, one's childish emotional regions, one's real
            body in various states and with special stimuli in addition to those
            from the body itself. With such explorative training one can do
            topological transformations which can result in stepwise changes in
            metaprogramming and in metaprograms them- selves.
            <strong
                >Bias, prejudice, preconception and intransigence in explicit
                areas are seen as supraselfmeta-programs which are
                inappropriate.</strong
            >
            Until there can be highly motivated mathematical transformations
            within the areas of control metaprograms, major changes are not
            made.

            The above alltoocondensed summary of these experiments and their
            results illustrates the linguistic symbolization of mathematical
            operations; this operation offers a certain kind of shorthand to the
            human computer.

            <em>The key is no key</em> is a version of the actual operations
            which it symbolizes. The statement is in the language of the child
            as the young computer originally stored it. The actual operations
            taking place in the adult symbolized by
            <em>the key is no key</em> are a complex rendering of more advanced
            ideas, some of which are circuit like, some of which are topological
            transformations and some of which are in multidimensional matrices.

            this is part of its supraselfmetaprograms. Maximum control over the
            metaprogrammatic level by the selfmetaprogram is achieved not by
            direct "one to one" orders and instructions from the one level to
            the other.

                transformations.</strong

            (This modeling reminds one of Ashby's
            <em>Design for a Brain, 1954,</em> in which a large "homeostat"
            stimulated in one small region makes large adjustments throughout
            itself in order to compensate for the small change.)

            One key in the mind is to hunt for those discontinuities in the
            structure of the thinking which reveal a critical turnover point at
            which one can exert emotional energy so as to cause a transformation
            in all of that region.

            The analogy of the <em>key in the lock is</em> part of this
            subject's human computer as a child. The <em>lock is</em> now
            transformed into an ndimensional choicepoint at which one could
            exert the proper amount of energy in the proper dimensions and in
            proper directions in those dimensions and find a radical
            transformation of all the metaprograms in that region of the
            computer. In a threedimensional <em>geometrical</em> model of such
            operations (in which one decreases the number of dimensions so that
            they can be visualized in visual space) one can think of oddlyshaped
            <em>rubber</em>
            surfaces connected on lines, on points and over large areas which
            are inflated to different amounts and differing pressures so as to
            fill a very large room. These membranes are of different colors and
            various regions are differently lighted and the whole is considered
            to be pulsing and changing shapes but not changing contact between
            surfaces, lines, or points. One can imagine one's self moving
            through these complex surfaces. There are various colors lighted
            from various directions. One hunts for that zone in which one can
            exert maximum amount of effect in terms of the redistribution of
            bond energies, over point, line, and surface areas of contact. One
            may also exert the maximum effect on the differential pressures in
            the spaces bounded by each of the surfaces where closed.

            After sufficient study of this model one discovers that the points
            of contact between the membranes are not as fixed as when first
            seen. What one saw at first was a frozen instant of time extending
            over a long period of time as if the model were static. Suddenly one
            realizes that the points of contact are the sharing of portions of
            these surfaces along appropriate lines at given instants and that
            these boundaries are changing constantly. One suddenly also
            discovers that the colors are moving over the surfaces and passing
            the boundaries. This particular model is a small region in a larger
            universe filled with such surfaces and intersections and spaces
            between. One also discovers that the light sources are within
            certain of these sheets shining through to others and that the hue
            and intensity are varying according to some local rules.

        <p>
            One moves away from the model and sees that it is filling a
            <em>universe;</em> one moves back into the model and begins to look
            carefully at one thin membrane. As the structure of the membrane is
            revealed and the structure of the inter- section between the
            membrane is seen, it turns out that there is microcircuitry within
            the membrane at a molecular and atomic level. there are energies
            moving in prescribed paths (sometimes in a noisy fashion) in
            multiple directions within the membrane. At the intersections
            collisions occur (electrons, mesons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos,
            etc. are moving from one sheet to the other in both directions).
            Sheets that are immediately adjacent are seen to be doing local
            computations at very high speed. The intersections are now seen as
            micromolecularatomic switch lines, switch surfaces, and switch
            points.

            Thus one finds that the phrase <em>The key is no key</em> has grown
            into a new conception of a computer. This computer within itself
            ideally recognizes no locks, no forbidden transitions, no areas in
            which data cannot be freely moved from one zone to another. At the
            boundaries of the computer, however, there are still, as it were
            <em>categorical imperatives.</em> Now the problem becomes not the
            boundaries within the computer but the boundaries outside it. By
            <em>outside</em> I do not mean only the integumentary boundaries of
            the real body. I mean other sources of influence than through the
            bottom layer of the external chemical physical reality (Fig. 1). To
            symbolize this doubt, this skepticism, about the boundaries of the
            computer and the influences that can be brought to bear upon them
            other than those coming through the physicalchemical reality, a line
            is placed above the supraselfmetaprograms and is labeled
            <em>unknown</em>
            (Fig. 1).

        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the mind of this subject the unknown must take precedence. It is
            placed above the supraselfmetaprogram because it contains some of
            the goals of this particular human computer.
            <strong
                >This exploration of the inner reality presupposes that the
                inner reality contains large unknowns which are worth exploring.
                However, to explore them it is necessary ( 1) to recognize their
                existence and (2) to prepare one's computer for the
                exploration.</strong
            >
            If one is to explore the <em>unknown</em> one should take the
            minimum amount of baggage and not load one's self down with
            conceptual machinery which cannot be flexibly reoriented to accept
            and investigate the unknown. The next stage of development of those
            who have the courage and the necessary inner apparatus to do it, is
            exploration in depth of this vast<em>inner unknown</em> region. For
            this task we need the best kind of thinking of which man is capable.
            We dissolve and/or reprogram the doctrinaire and ideological
            approaches to these questions.
        </p>

            To remain skeptical of even this formalization of this particular
            human computer's approach to this region is desirable. One does not
            overvalue this particular approach; one looks for alternative
            approaches for exploratory purposes. Freedom from the tyranny of the
            supraselfmetaprograms is sought but not to the point at which other
            human computers control this particular human computer. Deep and
            basic interlock between selected human computers is needed for this
            exploration. Conceptualization of the thinking machine itself is
            needed by the best minds available for this task. In a sense, we
            create the explorers in this area.
