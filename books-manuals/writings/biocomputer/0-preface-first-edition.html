        <h2>Preface to the First Edition</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            This work is the result of several years of personal effort to try
            to understand the various paradoxes of the mind and the brain and
            their relationships. It is felt that the basic premises presented in
            this work may help resolve some of the philosophical and theoretical
            difficulties which arise when one uses other viewpoints and other
            basic beliefs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Some of the major philosophical puzzles are concerned with existence
            of self, with the relation of the self to the brain, the self to the
            mind, and self to other minds, the existence or nonexistence of an
            immortal part of the self, and the creation of and the belief in
            various powerful phantasies in these areas of thought.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In Man there is a basic need for imagining wishfulfillments. Man's
            wishful thinking becomes interwoven among his best science and even
            his best philosophy. For the intellectual and the emotional
            advancement of each of us we need certain kinds of ideals. We also
            need ways of thinking which look as straight at the inner realities
            as at the physicalchemicalbiological <em>outer</em> realities. We
            need truly objective philosophical analysis inside ourselves as well
            as outside ourselves. This work is a summary of a current position
            in progress to try to attain objectivity and impartiality with
            respect to the innermost realities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One might well ask where is such theory applicable? Once mastered,
            it may be directly applied in selfanalysis. If one remembers that
            one's self is a feedbackcause with other human beings, one can start
            at this personal end of the system and achieve beginnings of
            interhuman analysis by analyzing one's self first. If successful,
            one may see one's self operating in improved fashions with other
            people, as judged by one's self and, much later, as judged by
            others. The reflections of one's intellectual and emotional growth
            later may begin to be distributed and are then seen operating in
            one's interhuman transactions- with one's wife, children, relatives,
            colleagues, and professional and business contacts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The persons who can understand and absorb this kind of theory need
            understand over a broad intellectual and emotional front. Each one
            needs understanding and training in depth in multiple fields of
            human endeavor. Those persons who probably can understand it best
            are the general scientists. * Among those in this group to whom I
            have presented the theory, there was immediate understanding and an
            immediate grasping of the basic fundamentals and of the consequence
            of the theory.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            A second group who have no difficulty with the computer aspects but
            who may have difficulty with the subjective aspects is that large
            group of young people who are becoming immersed more and more in
            computers, their use and programming. A few of these may have the
            necessary biological and psychoanalytic background to understand
            this viewpoint. Additional training may be given to these few in
            selfanalysis itself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Several members of a third group may find it useful with further
            study, the classically trained psychoanalytic scientists.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The psychoanalytic group may have difficulties in that very few are
            trained in the general purpose types of thinking involved in general
            purpose computers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            There are difficulties in the way of a multidisciplinary group, as a
            group, to use this theory. It seems necessary that each individual
            absorb the necessary kinds of thinking and kinds of motivations
            involved in each of the fields represented. Members of such groups
            can motivate one another to do individual learning in these areas
            and can help one another learn in these various areas. It is up to
            each responsible individual to absorb enough to gain understanding
            on the levels presented.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As with most insights into the innermost realities, it is felt that
            many of the advantages of this viewpoint cannot be seen directly
            until this way of thinking is absorbed into one's mind. The thinking
            machinery itself is at stake here. Once absorbed and understood I
            have found it possible to see that the properties and the operations
            of one's mind in many different states can be accounted for somewhat
            more satisfactorily. With the resulting increased control over
            conscious thinking and preconscious computations, with the newly
            enhanced respect for one's fixed unconscious (as if builtin)
            programs, the integration of one's self with the deeper inner
            realities becomes more satisfactory.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The theory is phrased in definite statements. However, it is not
            intended that the reader take this version as definitive, final,
            completed, or closed. Each of these definite statements is to be
            accepted only as a working hypothesis as currently presented by the
            author. My aim is not to make a new final philosophy, a new
            religion, or a new rigid way of approaching man's intellectual life.
            My aim is to increase the flexibility, the power, and the
            objectivity of our currently limited mind and its knowledge of
            itself. We have come a long way from the lowly primate to our
            present level. (However, we have a long way to go to realize the
            best obtainable from ourselves.) One has only to look at the
            inadequacies of Man's treatment of Man, and see how far we must go
            if we are to survive as a progressing species with better control of
            our battling animalistic superstitious levels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            It is expected that this theory will be useful in understanding and
            in programming not only one's self but other minds as well.
            Enhancement of the very human depths of communication with other
            minds may be approached. The current limits and the attainable
            limits for education, for reprogramming, for therapy and for
            cooperative efforts of all sorts between men, may be aided in the
            terms here presented. This is at least a hope of the author. Only
            time and use of this kind of thinking can test out the further
            working hypothesis.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One fact which must be appreciated for applying this theory is the
            essential individual uniqueness of each of our minds, of each of our
            brains. It is no easy work to analyze either one's self or someone
            else. This theory is not, cannot be, a miracle key to a given human
            mind. It is devilishly hard work digging up enough of the basic
            facts and enough of the basic programs and metaprograms controlling
            each mind from within to change its poor operations into better
            ones. This theory can help one to sort out and arrange stored
            information and facts into more effective patterns for change. But
            the basic investigation of self or of other selves is not easy or
            fast. Our builtin prejudices, biases, repressions and denials fight
            against understanding. Our Unconscious automatically controls our
            behavior. Eventually we may be able to progress farther. It may take
            several generations of those willing to work on these problems.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            I have a question about the wisdom of publishing too much of me,
            myself. I hesitate to publish in this small work certain personal
            observations in depth and in detail. If the society in which we live
            were more ideal, I might so publish. (Possibly in such an ideal
            society there might be no need for such work.) I do not know the
            answer, nor will I espouse the cause of thosewho feel they do know
            either the yes or the no answer. Frankly, I am an explorer in this
            area. My ambition is to be free to <strong>explore,</strong> not to
            <strong>exploit.</strong> I share what I experience because that is
            my profession-to search, to find, to discuss, and to write within
            Science what I find. Let others use what I may be privileged to find
            in their own professions, businesses, and/or pursuits. I have found
            that as soon as I go commercial, go political, or any other
            motivational endeavor, I lose what I personally prize most-my
            objectivity, my dispassionate appraisal, my freedom to explore the
            mind within my own particular limits. To make money, to cure
            someone, to rule, to be elec- ted, to grant money, to be a
            specialist in one science are all necessary and grand human
            enterprises needing per- sons of high intellectual and dedicated
            maturity. I do not seem to be of those (maybe I do or did not choose
            to be). In the United States of America in 1966, to insist on the
            explorer's role in the region of Man's innermost mind is to insist
            on being intellectually unconventional and to espouse a region of
            endeavor of research difficult to support. Grants for scientific
            research tend to be awarded by specialists to specialists; this is
            true in medical sciences as well as others. This current work cuts
            through too many specialties for that kind of support. I hope
            someday that approaches such as this one can be supported on their
            own merit.

        <p>
            Respect for the Unknown is hard to come by. Support for a science
            devoted to the Innermost Unknowns is needed.

        <!-- H2 METATHEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS-->
        <h2>METATHORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In general there are two opposing and different schools of thought
            on the basic origins of systems of thought or systems of
            mathematics. In a simplified way these two extreme positions can be
            summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- Ordered List with Paragraphs-->
        <ol>
            <!-- one -->
            <li>
                <p>
                    In the first position one makes the metatheoretical
                    assumption that a given system of thinking is based upon
                    irre- ducible postulates- the basic beliefs of the systems.
                    All consequences and all manipulations of the thinking
                    machine are then merely elaborations of, combinations of,
                    these assumptions operating upon data derived from the mind
                    and/or from the external world. This is called the
                    formalistic school. This school assumes that one can, with
                    suffi- ciently sophisticated methods, find those postulates
                    which are motivating and directing a given mind in its
                    operations. A further metatheoretical assumption is that
                    once one finds this set of postulates that then one can
                    account for all of the operations of that mind. (Whitehead
                    and Russell, 1927; Carnap, 1942-46; Tarski, 1946.)

            </li>
            <br />
            <!-- two -->
            <li>
                <p>
                    The opposing school at the opposite end of a spectrum of
                    schools, as it were, makes the metatheoretical assumption
                    that thinking systems arise from intuitive, essentially
                    unknowable, substrates of mental operations (Hilbert, 1950).
                    This school states that new kinds of thinking are created
                    from unknown sources. Further, one is not able to arrive at
                    all of the basic assumptions on which systems of thinking
                    operate. Many of the assumptions from this point of view
                    must be forever hidden from the thinker. Thus in this view
                    the origins of thinking are wide open. With this
                    metatheoretical assumption one can then conceive of the
                    existence in the future of presently inconceivable systems
                    of thought.

                    There is an intermediate position between these two extremes
                    in which one assumes the existence of both kinds and that
                    each of these two extremes has something to offer. Thus one
                    can select kinds of thinking which are subject to
                    formalistic analysis and formalistic synthesis based upon
                    basic beliefs. But this does not include all thinking. Some
                    kinds continue to be based in unknown areas, sources, and
                    methods. Metatheoretical selection is being done by
                    selection of the formal kind of thinking from a large
                    universe of other possibilities. This position does not
                    state that the origins of the basic beliefs are completely
                    specifiable. However, once some related basic beliefs are
                    found to exist, a limited system of rules of combination of
                    the basic beliefs giving internally consistent logical
                    results can be devised for limited use of that system. This
                    organization into a limited integral system of thinking and
                    the selection of those basic beliefs which naturally fit
                    into such systems of thinking, is a way of dividing off this
                    territory.

            Among many other metatheoretical ways of looking at one's own
            thinking machine and its activities is one which considers the
            unknown origins of basic beliefs and finding those whose origins are
            unknown. The whole problem of origin and the whole problem of how
            one constructs basic beliefs is at stake here.

        <p>
            If one takes a naturally occurring, thinking mind and obtains a
            sufficiently large sample of its thinking, one can have a
            metatheoretical faith that one can then find the basic beliefs and
            their origins. I am not too sure that such meta- theoretical faith
            in one's ability to adequately observe, adequately record, and
            adequately analyze mental events and construct them into logical
            explanations is warranted. With certain areas of thinking one can do
            this, with certain kinds of minds one can do this, but are not these
            the minds which have been organized along the known metatheoretical
            pathways? Are not these the minds which believe implicitly in
            metatheoretical terms in a basic set of beliefs and operate with
            them in an obvious direct logical fashion?

        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            May it not be better to conceive of minds and of criteria of
            excellence for general purpose minds in which one plugs in, as it
            were, metatheoretical positions which do not have only this area of
            applied formalism. In certain areas of thinking, of course, it is
            necessary to have a set of basic beliefs including those of the
            rules of various kinds of games that one must play in the external
            physical reality and in the social reality.* One can play these at
            different levels of abstraction with more or less excellence at
            playing, with or without dedication, etc. Interlock with external
            reality has its own requirements, not just those of the mind itself.
            In this paper external reality is not the area of major emphasis as
            can be seen in other portions of the paper. The interest of the
            author is more in the thinking machine itself, unencumbered. During
            those times when it is unencumbered by the necessities of interlock
            with other computers and/or with an external reality, its
            noninterlock structure can be studied. A given mind seen in pure
            culture by itself in profound physical isolation and in solitude is
            the raw material for our investigation (Lilly, 1956).

            Thus our major interests are in those metatheoretical positions
            which remain as open as possible to reasonable explanation and
            reasonable models of the thinking processes of the origins of
            beliefs, of the origins of self, the organization of self with
            respect to the rest of the mind, and the kinds of permissible
            transformations of self which are reversible, flexible, and
            introduce new and more effective ways of thinking.

            Is one of the sum and substance of one's experience, of one's
            genetics, genic inheritance, of one's modeling of other humans and
            of other animals and of plants, or is one something in addition to
            this? As we chip away at this major question of existence of self,
            as men have chipped away at this question over the millennia, we
            find that this kind of question and the attempt to answer it have
            led to new understandings, new mathematics, new sciences, new points
            of view and new human activities. If one attempts to conceive of
            one's self as having gone through another kind of evolution other
            than that of the human, if one attempts to conceive of himself
            having lived in an environment different from the social one that we
            have been exposed to, or if one attempts to imagine having evolved
            as an organism with the same (or greater) degree of intelligence in
            the sea or on a planet nearer the sun or farther from the sun, one
            realizes the essentially prejudiced nature of one's self. Let one
            carefully consider, for example, the genic mutations leading to
            different human form, structure, function and mental set. One
            metatheoretical position is that all such mutations in their proper
            combination exposed to the proper environment (of which there must
            be millions of possibilities) can survive and progress. In other
            words, even those mutations which are lethal now, may have survival
            value under special new and different conditions.<a

            If there is any truth in this statement then we should be doing a
            whole set of experiments on the adaptability and the seeking of the
            proper environment, proper peculiar diets, proper relation of
            sleepwakefulness, light to dark, amount of various kinds of
            radiation, amount of noise, amount of motion, and so forth for
            mutants at each stage in their life cycle. In other words, we should
            experiment with all of the vast parameters in which we have evolved
            and their variations in order to seek optimal survival values of
            these for the embryo, fetuses and children who do not survive under
            our peculiarly narrow range of values of these parameters. To change
            lethals to optimals seems possible and even probable with

            examples of which we see in the adult human population in all races
            around the world. This molecular cons- truction kit for organisms
            (through the exigencies of matings, of early embryonic development
            and growth, of the conditions imposed by mother, her diet and
            physical and social surroundings) gives rise to organisms which test
            experimentally the conditions imposed upon them and test how well
            the particular combination and particular values in their genic code
            are combined to form an integral complete organism for coping with

            We have not tested our own range of adaptability (as integral
            adults) to all possible environments. Scientifically we have little
            experience with the extreme; we know something of the extremes of
            temperature, of air and of water in which we can survive. We know
            something of the radiation limits within which we can survive. We
            know something of the oxygen concentrations in the air that we
            breathe, we know something of the light levels within which we can
            function. We know a little of the sound levels in which we can
            function, and so forth. We are beginning to see how the environment
            interlocks with our computer and changes its functioning. We are
            beginning to see how certain kinds of experiences with these
            conditions set up rules which we call physical science within our
            own minds. We are beginning to see how, if we change the external
            conditions, in a limited way within a limited piece of apparatus,
            that these rules must be changed in order to understand how we can
            model these changed conditions and the way that atoms, molecules,
            radiation and space behave, in our own minds. This century has seen
            vast advances in our modeling of radiation, material particles of
            matter, space, stars, galaxies, solid materials, liquids, and our
            small modifications of all of these. This century, however, has not
            seen a similar gain in our understanding of the operations of our
            own minds, of the essential origins of thinking, and of those
            conditions under which we can elect to create new thinking machines

            <a href="" title=""> Schrodinger *</a> said that the chromosome

            two dimensional solid; along its length it has a great strength and
            yet it is a flexible chain which can move and which can be split
            down the middle during mitosis. These carriers of the orders for our
            ultimate structure as an integral adult, their essential immortality
            in being passed from one individual to the next in creating the next
            individual in line, should not be neglected in any theory of the
            operation of our mind. It may be that our basic beliefs, the unique
            ones of each one of us, can be found by careful correlations between
            our essentially unique genic maps and our thinking limits. It may be
            that the kinds and levels of thinking of which each of us is capable
            is essentially determined by the genes which are contained in each
            of us. It may be that each of our private languages is genically
            determined. Even if this is true, that there is genic determinism in
            regard to our thinking machines, we are not yet at the point at
            which we can specify the levels of abstraction and the cognitional

            essential variables which are genically determined. This is an
            immensely difficult area for research. It will require the services
            of many talented individuals considering their own thinking
            processes, combined with a detailed knowledge of their genic

            mechanisms so laboriously worked out and discovered in the science
            of genetics. But these rules of genetics must not be limiting in the
            metatheory; they must enter as part of the knowledge of these
            talented individuals and at the correct level of abstraction for
            seeking the patterns of thinking which are genically controlled.

            This genic determinism of thinking can turn out to be a
            willo-thewisp. It may be that in the subsequent development of the
            computer it has become so general purpose that the original genetic
            factors and the genes are no longer of importance. Even as one can
            construct a very very large computer of solid state parts or of
            vacuum tube parts or of biological parts, it makes little difference
            as long as the total size, the excellence of the connections and the
            kinds of connections are such that one can obtain a general purpose
            net result from the particular machine. So may we possibly cancel
            out genic differences. So may each one of us, as it were, attain the
            same kinds of learning and the same kind of thinking machine little
            modified by genic differences.

            I do not wish to take sides on these issues. I merely wish to say
            that if one is to take an impartial and dispassionate view, one
            cannot afford to espouse deeply any fixed pattern of thinking with
            regard to these matters. I would prefer to see talented individuals
            with large mental capabilities investigating their own minds to the
            very depths. I want to aid these individuals in their communication
            of the results to others, with similar yet different talents. I
            believe that by using certain methods and means, some of which are
            presented in this work, that truly talented and dedicated
            individuals can forge, find, and devise new ways of looking at our
            minds, which are truly scientific, intellectually economical, and
            interactively creative. Consider, for example, the case of the
            fictitious individual created by the group of mathematicians
            masquerading under the name of Dr. Nicholas Bourbaki.

            This group of mathematicians in order to create a mathematics or
            sets of mathematics beyond the capacity of any one individual, held
            meetings three times a year and exchanged ideas, then went off and
            worked separately. The resulting papers were published under a
            pseudonym because the products of this work were felt to be a group
            result beyond any one individual's contribution.

            Whether or not this group was greater than or lesser than a single
            human mind, operating in isolation on similar materials, will not be
            known for some time. It may be that the human computer interlock
            achieved among these mathematicians created a new entity greater
            than any one of them in regard to modes of thinking, complexity of
            thinking, and creative new ideas. Certain kinds of things that Man
            does of necessity require tremendous amounts of cooperation among
            very large numbers of individuals. Such accomplishments are beyond
            any one individual and are a product only of the group effort. This
            is true, for example, in building the Empire State Building, a
            subway system, a railroad system, an airline, a large industrial
            factory, etc. In each of these cases there is a rearrangement of
            external realities, a setting up of a communication network between
            many individuals and a dedication of each of these individuals to
            the purposes of the organization of which they are a part. This is
            probably the greatest accomplishment of our industrial, military,
            educational and religious efforts in this century. Man's effective
            interlock with other men can accomplish certain kinds of things
            beyond any individual.

            However, in certain areas, gifted, talented, intelligent individuals
            seem to function almost autonomously as solitu- dinous computers
            giving rise to new findings. This is seen in the case of the
            mathematical geniuses raised in solation. One is almost afraid to
            educate such people for fear that they will lose their general
            purpose nature and their ability to make original creative
            contributions. Somehow or other they have escaped interlock into
            Man's ever more pervasive social organizations and their demands. As
            in the case of the creative physicist Moseley, who was drafted and
            killed in World War 1, such talent can be thrown away by the

            There is a point of view in the modern world and there are divisions
            among intellectuals which are wasting our use of talent and genius.
            There are antithetical philosophies which cause diversive
            intellectual activities. It may be that such conflict is necessary
            for the intellectual advancement of each individual. It may also be
            completely superfluous and nonsensical. C. P. Snow has pointed out
            in his writings (especially those about the two cultures) that one
            kind of social dichotomy about which I speak. The value systems of
            each intellectual reflect his prejudices, his biases, his
            blindnesses, as well as his areas of competence. It seems to be a
            very foolish maneuver to take that which one knows, that in which
            one is excellent and raise it above the general intellectual level
            of all other intellectuals. One technique of raising what one and
            one's most intimate colleagues know above the surrounding
            intellectual terrain is to literally dig an intellectual moat around
            one's field of activity. To dig this moat one demeans and denigrates
            areas of knowledge and individuals in those fields surrounding one's
            own field. This kind of activity seems to be almost builtin in our
