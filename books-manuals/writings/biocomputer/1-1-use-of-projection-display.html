            The use of the psychedelic agents (such as LSD<sub>25</sub>) in the
            human subject shows certain properties of these subs- tances in
            changing the computer's operations in certain ways. Some of these
            changes are mentioned above in passing; a summary of those found in
            the LSD state empirically are as follows:

                    These instructions are carried out with relatively short

                    complexity of the task which is being programmed into the
                    computer. It also is a previous history of this same kind of
                    programming: the more often it has been done the easier it
                    is to do again and the less time it takes.

                    positive end of the motivationfeelingemotion spectrum. With
                    the LSD<sub>25</sub> state the negative or the positive
                    charge can be changed to neutral or to its opposite by
                    special instructions. However, since most people wish to
                    avoid the negative and encourage the positive once they
                    obtain control over programming they tend to put a positive
                    charge even on programs and metaprograms and the processes
                    of creating them. (A chemical change may take place in
                    signal storage (Fig. 1) as the sign of the motivational
                    process shifts from negative to positive.)

            The following description gives examples of the successful uses of
            and the results with the freedom to program new instructions during
            the LSD state.
            <strong
                >It is to be emphasized for those who have not seen the
                phenomena within themselves that this kind of manipulation and
                control of one's own programs and its rather dramatic
                presentation to one's self is apparently not achievable outside
                of the use of LSD<sub>25</sub>.</strong
            >
            This amount of control can be said to resemble other ways of
            achieving control and visual projection but in actual intensity I
            know of no other way to achieve it. Hypnosis is a possible
            exception.

            In some cases during the eight or so possible hours of the special
            states of consciousness achievable with the help of
            LSD<sub>25</sub>,
            <strong>the use of visually projected images</strong> to aid in
            seeing the nature of one's own defensive, evasive, and idealization
            mechanisms can be realized.

                of others appear on or in place of</strong
            >
            the body image. Such stored images can be selected within certain
            limits, manipulated within other limits, or allowed to occur in a
            free association context, appearing as parallels of the current
            thoughtstream. The orders to self for the appearance of these
            phenomena may resemble the post- hypnotic suggestion instructions
            given during autohypnosis, the metaprogrammatic instructions to a
            very large computer for a certain type of display program with
            special content to be displayed, and the orders to a large organi-
            zation to produce a play with many actors operating in one place in
            space, one after the other, each with an assig- ned role not
            necessarily specified in detail. For periods of 30 or so minutes of
            objective time such projections can be maintained and worked with in
            the selfanalysis context; at the end of this time interval some
            fatigue is noted with subsequent stopping of the display.
            Reevocation can be achieved by a period of rest from this and
            similar tasks for a period of 15 minutes objective time. Several
            such periods can be evoked during a single session.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Areas of unconsciously operating taboos, denials and inhibitions are
            revealed (in negative, as it were) by the absence of appearance of
            the consciously desired and ordered projections in certain areas.
            Areas of unconscious elaboration show as projections of great detail
            and completeness even though no real remembered reality could
            possibly correspond to the projection. Screen memories (Bertram
            Lewin, et al.) show in great profusion. As the buried material
            behind the screen is uncovered, the screen memory disappears.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            An apparent defensive maneuver
            <em>is the flickering images</em> phenomena; the new images come at
            such a rapid rate (2 or 3 per objective second) like a slowed
            flickering movie that one cannot inspect any one image long enough
            to recognize its significance. Another alleged evasion is the
            melting, or mosaic, or distortion maneuver in which images flow in
            whole or plastically, or are broken up into parts like a mosaic, or
            parts are interchanged among several stored images at different
            levels.
            <strong
                >The melting, mosaic or distortion of course can be programmed,
                of itself, under direct orders. It is only considered an evasion
                when it is not under the control of the self.</strong

        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The current affect and its modulation by conscious wishing is
            immediately shown on the facial expression of the projection despite
            a lack of change in the objective face itself (proprioceptively,
            photographically, etc., detected). The projected face and the real
            face fit together in three dimensions. It is almost as if the
            perception systems were using the real face and recomputing it to
            give a different appearance, i.e., if the real face is held neutral
            then the <em>projected face</em> will manipulate the apparent
            features of the real face with accurate showing of anger, joy,
            sexual desire, hatred, jealousy, pleasure, pain, fear, psychic
            mutilation of ego, adoration of self, and several other such
            emotions. These have been studied by their mirrorprojections.

        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Conflicts can be projected in several ways: the images switch
            rapidly back and forth between the two conflicting categories,
            emotions, orders, persons, ideals, or other. Alternatively, parts
            (disparate parts) of the internalized argu- ment are projected side
            by side, giving a peculiar stereoscopic depthinconflict appearance
            to the display. Profound fatigue shows by showing <em>aged</em> or
            <em>diseased</em>
            splotchy images.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The negative operations which prevent certain contents reaching
            access to the display mechanism can be shown to exist by using
            alternate "acceptable to the ego ideal" routes to the display
            program and its projection. For example, material which cannot be
            projected onto one's own mirrored image, sometimes can be projected
            onto a color picture of someone else. In some cases the other person
            in the picture is most suitably and acceptably of the opposite sex
            (face alone, full body clothed, or unclothed) for the full use of
            the display of the desired material.
        </p>

            This latter "screen" is not a passive one and may say or do
            something on its own which either changes the projection or invokes
            a new program (such as the demanding external reality program) which
            may abolish the whole phenomenon of projection in the visual display
            itself. When one sees a visual projection onto the face of another
            person of, say, one's true deeper feelings, the realization may come
            that this happens to one all the time below the levels of awareness
            without the special powers attributable to this substance; i.e.,
            there is an already prepared unconscious "display" (which is here
            allowed access to the visual mechanism by the special conditions)
            which normally operates in the external reality program with other
            persons unconsciously or preconsciously. This firsttime finding can
            have therapeutic benefits in the consequent selfanalysis of one's
            human relations.
