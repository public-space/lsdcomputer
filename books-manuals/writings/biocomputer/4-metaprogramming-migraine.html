        <p>
            Specific example is given some experiments were done on
            reprogramming a specific biocomputer (migraine case) in the LSD<sub
                >25</sub
            >
            state.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Under certain special circumstances it has been found possible to
            program certain trends in perception and project them into the
            visual space for study. Among such processes are
            <em>the apparent presence of other persons.</em> One's belief in the
            reality of these <em>presences is</em> not at stake here. Unless one
            purposely intensifies the belief in the reality of these presences,
            one can detect that they are not
            <em>existing in the external reality.</em>
            The safe metaprogram to use is that they exist only in the mind even
            though they appear to exist outside the body.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One may ask the question do these programs exist continuously below
            the threshold of consciousness in the usual mental state, or are
            they created de novo in or by the LSD<sub>25</sub> state? Current
            psychoanalytic and psychiatric theories state that they exist in the
            "unconscious" below the levels of awareness and are evoked from that
            region of the computer by the LSD<sub>25</sub> state. All we can say
            here is that this looks like the more likely of the two
            alternatives; however, the other one should be kept in mind. Some of
            these belowthresholdprograms once detected with the LSD<sub>25</sub>
            state can (in solitude without LSD<sub>25</sub>) be just detected
            near threshold in a highly motivated state. Without LSD<sub>25</sub>
            one can achieve the necessary excitation of these programs to force
            them above threshold.
        </p>

            In one particular subject migraine was used as an advantageous
            <em>tracer</em> and a spur to the selfanalysis. In this case there
            were asymmetries of the spatial perception fields. The right side of
            the visual field was very different from the left side. (What was
            seen from the right eye was different from that seen with the left
            eye.) These differences reside in color, in the persistence of
            afterimages, in the occurrences of scotoma during a migraine attack,
            etc. (As is well known in the clinical literature such conditions
            can exist easily forty years or more.) Among these asymmetries there
            are spatial distortions of the visual system. In this particular
            case the right eye is more sensitive, has a lower threshold for
            photophobia and pain in general. The sensations and skin perceptions
            on the right side of the head are less pleasant and stronger than
            those on the left. The migraine attack is confined to the right side
            of the head.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            At times correct programming can be achieved in the LSD<sub>25</sub>
            state so that these cephalic differences can be enhanced, studied,
            and projected. Recall and living out of past experiences from
            childhood show a traumatic use of the right side of the head. In the
            LSD<sub>25</sub> state abrupt physical blows to the right side of
            the head with violent shrinking away from the source, with right eye
            closure falling away to the left, and brief apparent "loss of
            consciousness" was experienced.</em> This is an example of <em>along-term
            (apparently) builtin unconscious program. This experience was not
            elicited without the help of the LSD<sub>25</sub> state nor without the help of
            abreactions in classical psychoanalysis. All that can be seen of
            this program during the usual daily e.r. state is the asymmetry of
            perception.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>In the LSD<em>25</em> state this autonomous program generated some <em>presences not 
            real but perceived as if real.</em> When with proper metaprogramming this 
            effect was raised above threshold, the presences were felt and seen as 
            shadowy creatures or persons coming in from the right side of the visual 
            field out of darkness. The impression is that the spatial field of perception 
            becomes distorted in such a way that the presences can penetrate the distorted field.</p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>In thinking about this effect the patient generated a theory 
            of the projections <em>as if it was no projection.</em> The patient 
            states that these are <em>beings from another dimension penetrating 
            through a hole between their and our universes.</em> (This attribution 
            of causes makes no sense unless it is believed implicitly.) 
            Once the intensity of belief in this system is lowered, the 
            critical threshold for the distortion of the perceptual field 
            becomes obvious and the unconsciously programmed projection 
            process becomes detectable. The artificial beings now are no 
            longer that, they are merely distortions of the visual field 
            because of some peculiar development of the nervous system. 
            The dramatic bringing in
            of <em>external beings</em> was shown to have a need of its own, a 
            relief from the solitude and isolation. Essential loneliness 
            gives rise to the creation of those beings within this particular 
            person. The necessity of projecting his own anger and fears by the 
            creation of these <em>beings</em> was found in the subsequent analysis.</p>
