        <h2>Definition of a General Purpose Self-Metaprogram</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The essential features and the goals sought in the selfanalysis are
            in the metaprogram:
            <strong><em>make the computer general purpose.</em></strong> In this
            sense we mean that
            <strong
                >in the general purpose nature of the computer there can be no
                display, no acting, nor an ideal which is forbidden to a
                consciouslywilled metaprogram. Nor is any display, acting or
                ideal made without</strong
            >
            being <strong>consciously metaprogrammed.</strong> In each case of
            course one is up against the limits of the unique computer which is
            one's own. There are certain kinds of metaprograms, displays,
            acting, or ideals which are beyond the capacity of a particular
            computer. However,
            <strong
                >one's imagined limits are sometimes smaller than those which
                one can achieve with special work.</strong
            >
            The metaprogram of the specific beliefs about the limits of one's
            self are at stake here. One's ability to achieve certain special
            states of consciousness, for example, are generally preprogrammed by
            basic beliefs taken on in childhood. If the computer is to maintain
            its general pur- pose nature (which presumably was there in
            childhood), one must recapture a far greater range of phenomena than
            one expects that one has available. For instance, one should be able
            to program in practically any area possible within human
            imagination, human action or human being.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As explorations deepen, one can see the evading nature of many
            programs which one previously considered basic to one's private and
            professional philosophy. As one opens up the depths, it is wise not
            to privately or publicly espouse as <em>ultimate</em> any
            <em>truths</em> one <em>finds</em> in the following areas: the
            universe in general, beings not human, thought transference, life
            after death, transmigration of souls, racial memories,
            species-jumpingthinking, nonphysical action at a distance, and so
            forth.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Such ideas may merely be a reflection of one's needs in terms of
            one's own survival.<strong>
                Ruthless selfanalysis as to one's needs for certain kinds of
                ideas in these areas must be explored honestly and truthfully.
                The rewarding and positivelyreinforcing effects of</strong
            >
            LSD<sub>25</sub>
            <strong
                >must be remembered and emphasized; one overvalues the results
                of one's chemically rewarding thinking.</strong
            >
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Once one has done such deep analysis one later finds deeper that
            these needs were generating these ideas. One's public need to
            proclaim them to one's self and to others, as if they are the
            ultimate truth, is an expression of one's need to believe. Insight
            into the fact that one is enthused because the positive,
            startand-maintain, rewarding sign has been chemically stamped on
            these ideas must be remembered.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            An explorer operating at these depths cannot afford such childish
            baggage. These are disguises of and evasions of the ultimate
            dissolution of self; the maintenance of pleasure and of life are
            insisting on denial of death. If one stops at these beliefs, no
            progress in further analysis can be made. These beliefs are
            <em>analysis dissolvers.</em> One might call these lazy assumptions
            which prevent one from pushing deeper into self and avoid expending
            any great effort in this deeper direction. One of these very
            powerful evasions is an hedonistic acceptance of things as they are
            with con- version of most of them to a pleasant glow. Another
            similar evasion is deferring discussion of such basic issues until
            one's <em>life after death.</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            A possibly great spur to work in this area for certain kinds of
            persons is the acceptance of unknowables and of the unknown itself.
            A powerful wish to push into the unknown further than those ahead of
            one in calendar time is helpful in terms of one's motivation at this
            point. Everyone has his say about the truth in this area. Many other
            persons would like very much to have one follow their metaprograms.
            In my own view I would prefer to be a questing mind reporting on
            some interesting journeys. In so far as I fail to be this, I am
            guilty of attempting to metaprogram the reader.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In summary then one starts on the deeper journeys, independently,
            metaprogrammed properly, and relatively safe but without evasions.
            After having been through some of the innermost depths of self, a
            result is that they are only one's own beliefs and their multitudes
            of randomized logical consequences deep down inside one's self.
            There is nothing else but stored experience.
