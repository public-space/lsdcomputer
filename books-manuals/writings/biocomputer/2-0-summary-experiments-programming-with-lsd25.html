        <h2>
            Summary of Experiments in SelfMetaprogramming with LSD<sub>25</sub>
        </h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In order to test the validity of some of the basic assumptions
            implicit in the theory of the human computer, a series of
            experiments were designed and carried out in the LSD<sub>25</sub>
            state, in physical isolation, and solitude. One point of primary
            interest during these experiments was to find out what level of
            intensity of belief in a set of assumptions could be achieved. The
            assumptions tested in this set of experiments are not those of
            current science: they are not in the conscious working repertory of
            this scientist; nor were they consciously acceptable to him.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In this short account it is not intended to give all of the details
            of either the selfmetaprogramming language that was used or the
            details of the elicited phenomena. The account is purposely sparse,
            condensed, and compressed. Abstracted from the complexity of the
            totality of the experiments and their results are only those
            <em>formal</em>
            descriptions which may serve as guide posts to others attempting to
            reproduce these or similar experiments. It is not intended to
            complicate this account with the personal aspects of the
            metaprogramming, the elicited phenomena or difficulties encountered.
            For those researchers who are interested in this works reproduction
            in themselves, these assumptions (or similar ones) and these results
            can be translated into their own metaprogramming language and such
            workers can obtain their unique results.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            To claim validity of details beyond myself is not my aim. There
            probably are those men who are prepared well enough to attempt
            reproducing what has been done here in themselves. The descriptions
            are given so that the sources of the human computer theory are
            available to professionals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            This particular set of existence theorems is selected for experiment
            for a number of reasons. There are a number of persons (Blum, 1964)
            who experimented with the LSD<sub>25</sub> state who write as if
            they believe implicitly in the objective reality of causes outside
            themselves for certain kinds of experiences undergone with these
            particular beliefs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            I do not think it wise to espouse either the existence or the
            nonexistence theorem for this set of basic supraselfmetaprograms
            (Fig. 1).
            <strong>To become impartial, dispassionate, and</strong>
            <em>general purpose,</em>
            <strong
                >objective, and openended, one must test and adjust the level of
                credence in each of his sets of beliefs.</strong
            >
            If ever Man is to be faced with real organisms with greater wisdom,
            greater intellect, greater minds than any single man has, then we
            must be open, unbiased, sensitive, general purpose, and
            dispassionate. Our needs for phantasies must have been analyzed and
            seen for what they are and are not or we will be in even graver
            troubles than we are today.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Our search for mentally healthy paths to human progress in the
            innermost realities depends upon progress in this area. Many men
            have floundered in this area of belief: I hope this work can help to
            find a way through one of our stickiest intellectual-emotional
            regions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Most of these beliefs are ones which have been abandoned in the
            fields of endeavor called science. Such beliefs continue to be found
            in the field known as religion. Some of these beliefs are labeled in
            modern psychiatric medicine and anthropology as
            <em>superstitions, psychotic beliefs,</em> etc. Other persons
            present these beliefs in the writings called
            <em>science fiction.</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            This set of basic postulates (or beliefs) is conceived and used to
            program several sessions with LSD<sub>25</sub> plus physical
            isolation in solitude. Above all these metaprograms to be
            experimented upon is one metaprogram of value to this subject his
            overall policy is the intent to explore, to observe, to analyze.
            Hence there is an important additional
            <strong>basic metaprogram:</strong>
            <em
                >analyze self to understand one 's thinking and true motives
                more thoroughly.</em
            >
            This is the conscious motivational strategy. At times this
            metaprogram dominates the scene, at times others do. The resolve
            exists, however, to generate a net effect with this instruction
            uppermost in the computer hierarchy.
