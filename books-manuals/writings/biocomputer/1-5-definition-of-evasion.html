        <h2>DEFINITION OF EVASION OF ANALYSIS OF METAPROGRAMS</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In using the term <em>evasion</em> it is meant to imply a similar
            concept to <em>defensive maneuvers</em> or <em>defenses of</em> the
            psychoanalytic literature. However, in addition to the content of
            these concepts, <strong>evasion is defined as</strong>
            <em
                >any program or metaprogram entered upon to avoid, to hide, or
                to distort a deeper program or metaprogram which is too
                seductive or too threatening or too chaotic for the
                selfprogrammer at that particular time.</em
            >
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            At the beginning in the profound isolation situation many people
            experience a fear which is an almost <em>disembodied</em> fear with
            no referents in the external reality. With experience this fear can
            be shown to be a fear of one's own inner unknowns. After a thorough
            exploration of the various evasive metaprograms, it can be shown
            that the only thing to fear in this area is fear itself, in
            overwhelming amounts. With sufficient training it can be shown that
            one can convert the motivational sign of the experienced emotion
            from negative to positive. As to whether or not one must go through
            some of the negative emoting in order to experience enough of the
            punishing aspects to avoid them is a moot point.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            A great deal of selfdiscipline is required in this instance to
            pursue the negatively tinged programs and metaprograms stored in
            memory. At times one can detect an almost hedonistic withdrawal from
            further consideration of unpleasant events and memories. These
            evasions into pleasure are also evasions of further selfanalysis.
            <strong>As one clears</strong> up more and more
            <strong
                >areas of unpleasant programs and metaprograms, the increasing
                amounts of pleasurable programming and metaprogramming and their
                control can become a very seductive evasion of one's ideal of
                selfanalysis.</strong
            >
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            It is at this point that too frequent exposure to these conditions
            must be avoided. Long periods of interlock with the external reality
            must then be done. Sometimes this may necessitate months of outside
            work to integrate one's findings with the real world as one has
            chosen to live in it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The easily evoked pleasure of the LSD<sub>25</sub>
            <strong
                >state may become for some persons a major goal. To make sure
                that one does not get seduced by this induced state of pleasure
                it is wise to avoid further experiments for several weeks or
                several months, and reassert the natural accesses to pleasure in
                one's external reality. The external reality struggle to obtain
                pleasure from the environment has rules of its own which must be
                met realistically and with intelligence and balance.</strong
            >
            Here it is obvious that discipline in the selfmetaprogrammer is
            absolutely essential. Further progress in selfanalysis cannot be
            made without selfdiscipline.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            With this caution let us return to the profound isolation situation.
            In the zero level external reality situation the use of any external
            reality screen can be defined as a defensive maneuver to avoid
            visualizing or experiencing what one fears most in the deeper levels
            of one's computer, i.e., in the unconscious. The uses of the screens
            are necessary and useful steps on the way in and are useful steps to
            return to for confirmation at later times of the findings. An
            apparently paradoxical situation thus exists in the profound
            physical isolation situation. One is pursuing selfanalysis and
            accesses to the keys to pleasure within one's self and keys to
            lessening the pain and fear in one's self.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            However, once one has unlocked the pleasure and attenuated the pain
            one must use the resulting released energies and attach them somehow
            to the external reality programs and the ideals
            (supraself-metaprograms) which one has set up. One does not
            dissipate all of this pleasure in hedonistic and narcissistic
            gratification. One of the pitfalls of LSD<strong>25</strong>
            experiences is exactly this: one has the power now to stay in an
            expanded state of pleasure, as it were, for several hours. This can
            become quite seductive and one can become quite lazy and return to
            this state at every opportunity. However this is not selfanalysis,
            this state is the ecstasy, or bliss, or transcendent state sought by
            the religious proponents of the use of LSD<sub>25</sub> for
            <em>religious purposes.</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            These findings are very similar if not identical to those found in
            classical psychoanalysis. Once repressions and denials are released
            during the analysis, the access of pleasurable activity increases
            rapidly. The same temptations exist to become a pleasureseeking
            organism; however, this tendency too must be analyzed in the
            classical situation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            When one compares the classical analytical situation to the
            solitudinous selfanalysis situation one must be quite aware of what
            has been sacrificed in each case. The advantage of the external
            analyst being present listening to one producing the material is
            that one avoids some of the pitfalls of solitude in that some of the
            above evasions can be pointed out rapidly before one became too
            involved in them. On the other hand the interpretations of the
            analyst can be a distraction from pursuing in depth certain aspects
            of one's own selfanalysis. Even solitudinous selfanalysis using
            LSD<sub>25</sub> should be referred back to an external analyst at
            times when large amounts of powerfully acting uncon- scious programs
            have been unearthed. Some programs tend to be
            <em>acted out</em> after profound solitude and isolation
            experiences, as well as they do during classical analysis. This is
            one of the risks and the gambles of this technique. This is why one
            is cautioned to use subjects who have become sophisticated with
            regard to psychoanalysis itself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            During one's classical psychoanalysis one begins to modify one's
            computer and the selfprogrammer to include many aspects of the
            methods of computation that one's analyst uses. One accumulates as
            it were a metaprogram of selfanalysis which incorporates a good deal
            of what one's analyst has to offer with regard to one's own
            computer. In classical psychoanalytic terms one tends to
            <em>incorporate many aspects of one's analyst.</em> Once one has a
            satisfactorily functioning internal analyst, i.e., an analytical
            metaprogram for the selfmetaprogram, one can be launched on one's
            own and no longer needs the external analyst to the same degree that
            one did earlier. One's analysis has proceeded from the analyst
            outside to the analyst inside.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            An analogous situation can be seen in the profound isolation and
            LSD<sub>25</sub> analysis. The foregoing descriptions of the
            external screens and external projection methods emphasize the
            relationship between the computer and the external reality. It also
            emphasized that the computer was using certain parts of itself for
            transformations and projections of data from memory into systems
            stimulated by energies coming from the external world. It was
            pointed out that such projections were easier to do than when these
            systems were not excited by energies coming from the outside world.
            The major reason for failure to be able to project on the
            <em>blank screens</em> or to use the apparatus unexcited by energies
            coming from the outside world is too great fear of what lies
            underneath below the levels of awareness in the solitudinous
            situation. Once a large number of these fears have been analyzed and
            shown to be peculiarly childlike and childish, one can proceed to
            the next stage of LSD<sub>25</sub> and isolation combined for
            analysis.
