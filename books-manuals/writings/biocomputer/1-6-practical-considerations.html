        <h2>Practical Considerations</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As a pragmatic matter one should do selfanalysis in the severely
            attenuated physical reality without LSD<sub>25</sub> for several
            exposures before using the substance. One must learn not only to
            tolerate but to like the experience for several hours at a time.
            One's fears of the unreleased unconscious programming can be
            attenuated and analyzed during this period.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Training sessions with LSD<sub>25</sub> with another person must be
            done before it is combined with the profound physical isolation and
            solitude. During this period training by the external screens and
            the projections can be done with doses of LSD<sub>25</sub> from 100
            micrograms minimum to the tolerated maximum of that individual.
            During this period one must face the fears of LSD<sub>25</sub>
            itself and the fears mentioned above of damage to one's brain and
            one's mind by this agent. One must also face the hedonistic,
            narcissistic pleasure induction and maintenance possible with
            LSD<sub>25</sub>, and one must make one's own decision about how to
            handle these pleasures versus those which are brought about in the
            external reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the profound physical isolation situation one acquires, or one
            has, or one develops a confidence in one's body to function quite
            automatically and to take care of itself. The whole problem of air
            supply, keeping one's face above the water, the action of
            respiration and of heart, etc., are all turned over to the
            protohuman survival programs to maintain themselves. All tendencies
            on the part of a subject to control or to monitor his own
            respiration or his own heart action should be discouraged. The same
            applies to the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract.
            Insofar as can be achieved automatic operations of these systems
            should be encouraged. Gradually they will assume their proper
            lowlevel expression in the psychic life of the individual subject.
            Confidence in their continued operation without attention by one's
            self (by the selfmetaprograms) can be achieved. These considerations
            are particularly important with the LSD<sub>25</sub> as the physical
            isolation and solitude begin to develop.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            On the analytic side one must have analyzed and dealt with one's
            unconscious death wishes. Up to a certain critical point one knows
            and feels the probability of survival under conditions over which
            one has control. One has already experienced internal mechanisms
            which may have tried to take over and deal a death-seeking blow to
            one. This kind of material must have been thoroughly analyzed with
            an external analyst before one approaches experiments such as these.
            One's self and one's analyst must be content that the level of
            control of such internal mechanisms is such that the probability of
            their dealing a deathseeking blow is low enough to risk exposure to
            these new conditions. This point cannot be emphasized strongly
            enough. Those who are acquainted with the phenomena during classical
            psychoanalysis realize that certain kinds of personalities and
            certain individuals during analysis and after analysis can go
            through depressive phases in which such death wishes can be acted
            out.
            <strong
                >The seeds of destruction of self can be buried in the deeper
                metaprograms and programs of one's own computer. Certain kinds
                of neuronal activities can destroy an organism.</strong
            >
            These are the kinds of activities which one must know and be aware
            of the signs and the symbols of evocation of these systems within
            one's self.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Such negative phenomena are usually seen after the first session or
            two with LSD<sub>25</sub>. The residual unanalyzed portion of these
            programs are usually projected and acted out as a consequence of
            their release by this agent. Several analytic sessions with an
            external analyst are thus necessary for maximum safety and minimum
            risk in these experiments.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the farthest and deepest state of isolation, one's basic needs
            and one's assumptions about self become evident. The existence of
            self and one's belief in the existence of one's self are made
            manifest. The positive or negative sign of values that one places
            upon one's self and upon the existence of one's self begins to show
            its force and strength. The problems discussed, but generally
            unfaced in a religious context in the external real world, are faced
            and can be lived out with a freedom unavailable since childhood.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The problem of the dissolution of one's conscious self by death of
            the body is studiable. One's evasions of this problem and of facing
            it can be projected into studiable areas of one's experience. The
            existence theorem for spiritual and psychic entities is also
            testable and the strength of one's belief in these entities can be
            analyzed. Evasions of selfanalysis and evasions of taking on certain
            kinds of beliefs can be tested.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In this area the denial and negation mechanisms of classical
            psychoanalysis show their strength. Previous analysis can train one
            to recognize that when data cannot be called up or when displays
            cannot be constructed or when certain operations cannot be carried
            out, one can see the cause currently existing. The set of inhibitory
            and repressive devices in one's computer is hard at work. In such
            inhibitory and repressive states preprogrammed sets of basic
            assumptions to be explored are incompletely carried out. One quickly
            finds areas of the consequences of the assumed beliefs, which one
            cannot enter or only enters with fear, with anger, or with love,
            carried over from some other programming.
