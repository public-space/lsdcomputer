        <h2>Inner Cogniton Space</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As one proceeds from outer or external projection analysis to
            internal projection analysis, one moves the excitation of projection
            systems by external energies to a lack of such excitation in these
            systems. For example, in the profound blackness and darkness of the
            floatation room there is no visual stimulus coming to the eyes or
            the visual systems. Similarly in the profound silence there are no
            sounds coming into the acoustic apparatus, and similarly the other
            systems are at a very low level of stimulation from the external
            world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One might expect then that these systems would appear to be
            absolutely quiet, dark and empty. This is not so. This is the area
            in which most subjects begin to get into trouble. It is also the
            area in which psychiatric and clinical judgments may interfere with
            the natural development of the phenomena.
            <strong
                >In the absence of external excitations coming through the
                natural end organs the perception systems maintain this
                activity.</strong
            >
            The excitation for this activity comes from other parts of the
            computer, i.e., from program storage and from internal body sources
            of exci- tation. The selfprogrammer interprets the resultant filling
            of these perceptual spaces at first as if this excitation were
            coming from outside. In other words, the sources of the excitation
            are interpreted by the self as if coming from the real world. For
            certain kinds of persons and personalities this is a very disturbing
            experience in one sphere or another; for them it is explicable only
            with telepathy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            We have been taught from babyhood that this kind of phenomena in a
            totally conscious individual is somehow forbidden, antisocial and
            possibly even psychotic.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One must analyze this metaprogram that has been implanted in one
            from childhood, examine its rationality or lack of same and proceed
            in spite of this kind of an interpretation of the phenomena that
            occur. Once one has analyzed this as an evasion or a defensive
            maneuver against seeing the
            <strong>true state of affairs</strong> one can allow oneself to go
            on and experience the deeper set of phenomena without interfering
            with the <strong>natural metaprograms.</strong> After achieving this
            level of freedom from anxiety, one can then go on to the next
            stages. (The programming orders for these inner happenings to take
            place are worked out in advance of the session, at first written
            down or spoken into a recorder. Later such orders can be programmed
            without external aids.)
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The following phenomenological description has been experienced by
            one subject under these special conditions.
            <em
                >One experiences an immediate internal reality which is
                postulated by the self It is apparent to me that one's own
                assumptions about this experience generates the whole
                experience. The experienced affects, the apparent appea- rance
                of other persons, the appearance of other beings not human,
                one's own past phantasies, one's own selfanalysis, each can be
                programmed to happen in interaction with those parts of one's
                self beyond one's conscious awareness.</em
            >
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The content experienced under these conditions lacks strong reality
            clues. <em>Externally real</em> displays are not furnished; the
            excitation from the reality outside does not pattern the displays.
            Therefore the projections which do occur are from those systems at
            the next inward level from the operations of the perception
            apparatus devoted to external reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The phenomena that ensue are described by one subject as follows:
            <em
                >the visualization is immersed in darkness in three dimensions
                at times but only when one evades the emerging</em
            >
            <strong>"multidimensional cognitive and conative space." </strong
            ><em
                >One is aware of "the silence" in the hearing sphere; this too
                gives way to the new space which is developing. The body image
                fluctuates, appearing and disappearing, as fear or other need
                builds up. As with the "darkness and the silence" so with the
                presence or absence of the body image.</em
            >
            Progress in using these projection spaces is measured by one's
            ability to neither project external reality data from storage into
            these spaces nor to project into these spaces "the absence of
            external reality stimuli."
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One can project in the visual space living images (external reality
            equivalents) or blackness (the absence of external reality images).
            One can project into the acoustic spaces definite sounds, voices.
            etc. (as if external reality) or one can project
            <em>silence</em> (the absence of sound) in the external reality. One
            can project the body image also, flexing one's muscles, joints, etc.
            to reassure oneself the image is functioning with
            <em>real feedback</em> or one can have a primary perception of a
            <em>lack of the body image</em> which is the negative logical
            alternative to the body image itself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In each of these dichotomized situations one is
            <em>really</em> projecting external reality and its equivalents
            (positive or nega- tive). In order to experience the next set of
            phenomena one must work through these dichotomous symbols of the
            external world and realize that they are evasions of further
            penetration to deeper levels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Once one abandons the use of projection of external reality
            equivalents from storage, new phenomena appear.
            <strong
                >Thought and feeling take over the spaces formerly occupied by
                external reality equivalents.</strong
            >
            (In the older terminology ego expands to fill the subjectively
            appreciated inner universe). "Infinity" similar to that in the usual
            real visual space is also involved and one has the feeling that
            one's self extends infinitely out in all directions. The self is
            still centered at one place but its boundaries have disappeared and
            it moves out in all directions and extends to fill the limits of the
            universe as far as one knows them. The explanation of this
            phenomenon is that one has merely taken over the perception spaces
            and filled them with programs, metaprograms, and selfmetaprograms
            which are now modified in the inner perception as if external
            reality equivalents. This transform, this special mental state, to
            be appreciated must be experienced directly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In one's ordinary experience there are dreams which have something
            of this quality and which show this kind of a phenomenon.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            At this level various evasions of realization of what is happening
            can take place. One can "imagine" that one is traveling through the
            real universe past suns, galaxies, etc. One can "imagine" that one
            is communicating with other beings in these other universes.
            However, scientifically speaking, it is fairly obvious that one is
            not doing any of these things and that one's basic beliefs determine
            what one experiences here. Therefore we say that
            <strong
                >the ordinary perception spaces, the ordinary projection spaces,
                are now filled with cognition and conation processes.</strong
            >
            This seems to be a more reasonable point of view to take than the
            <em>oceanic feeling,</em> the
            <em>at oneness with the universe</em> as fusing with Universal Mind
            as reported in the literature by others for these phenomena.
            <strong>These states</strong> (or
            <em>direct perceptions of reality</em> as they have been called)
            <strong
                >are one's thought and feeling expanding into the circuitry in
                one's computer usually occupied by perception of external
                reality in each and every mode,</strong
            >
            including vision, audition, proprioception, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            A small digression here for purposes of clarifying problems of
            experiencing these phenomena In addition to the above discussed
            factors about fears preventing these phenomena from developing, one
            must also neutralize various clinical psychiatric explanations and
            judgments about these phenomena. If one assumes that going through
            these phenomena is a dangerous procedure in that one might become
            enamoured of them and hence get into an irreversible psychosis, one
            also can be kept from experiencing these phenomena directly. Since
            the real necessary and sufficient conditions for the induction of a
            psychosis are not yet understood, one should not jump to the
            conclusion that these phenomena themselves are or can cause a
            psychosis. This has yet to be proven to the satisfaction of everyone
            in the field. It may be that professional fear is preventing our
            further analysis of these phenomena. The whole issue of insight into
            one's own mental processes, the whole issue of selfdiscipline and
            inspecting and understanding these processes are at stake here.
            Those who believe that there is a psychosis impending in all normal
            people (including professionals) have definite troubles with these
            kinds of phenomena. Heuristically such beliefs are untenable; such
            beliefs tend to weaken one's selfdiscipline under these
            circumstances and make one rather unfit for such experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            A satisfactory analysis of the clinical psychiatric judgments sphere
            must take place in all trained subjects before proceeding further.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Unless one can move philosophically and scientifically far enough to
            see the utility of going through these experien- ces there can be a
            rapid withdrawal, a faulting out of self from the whole project. One
            is not willing to undergo the phantasy "dangers" that one sets up
            ahead of time before going through the experiences. One's fears in
            this sphere are usually around the questions of whether one will
            maintain insight into these processes once one has exposed one's
            self to LSD<sub>25</sub>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Candidly considered one may ask
            <em
                >may not this substance under these conditions change my brain
                and mind structure irreversibly out of my control?</em
            >
            The proper controls on whether or not there are permanent changes in
            brains have not been done on animals' nor on humans' brains. So
            there definitely is a risk in this area. Is one willing to gamble on
            this particular risk? It is wise to face up to these questions
            candidly, honestly, and ruthlessly. One is moving into an area which
            is filled with unknowns of primary importance. The issue of brain
            and mind injury is a current and important issue which has not been
            faced by the enthusiasts for LSD<sub>25</sub>. It is an issue
            constantly raised by those who are opposed to the use of
            LSD<sub>25</sub>. The science of finding out whether or not there is
            any truth in either side (pro or con) is lacking. The pro LSDgroup
            tries to do spectacular things using it. The congroup looks askance
            at the enthusiasm of the other group and claims that they have lost
            their insight and are hedonistically overvaluing the effects
            experienced subjectively. The contragroup tend to claim
            <em>brain damage and/or mind damage;</em> the progroup tends to

            and a
            <em>new approach to the psychotherapy of recalcitrant diseases</em>
            such as alcoholism (I leave out here the artistic, religious, and
            philosophical claim - see Leary, Alpert and Metzner, 1964). The
            turning point between the pros and cons of the use of LSD25 hinges
            once more philosophically at the edge of this cognitiveconative
            projection space phenomena: does one lose one's insight and
            initiative by going here? This question should be asked and answered
            scientifically and experimentally.
