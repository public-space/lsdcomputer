        <h2>METAPROGRAMMATIC RESULTS OF BELIEF EXPERIMENTS</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The metatheoretical consideration of these experiments and the
            results are as follows: One suprametaprogrammatic assumption about
            these experiments is the formalistic view of the origins of
            mathematics and of thinking. As was said in the preface, at one
            extreme of the organization of human thinking is
            <em>the formal <strong>logical basic assumption</strong></em> set of
            metatheories. These experiments were done with this view in mind and
            the results were interpreted from this point of view.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Obviously this point of view does not test the "objective" validity
            of the experiences. It merely assumes that, if one plugs the proper
            beliefs into the metaprogrammatic levels of the computer that, the
            computer will then construct (from the myriads of elements in
            memory) those possible <em>experiences</em> that fit this particular
            set of rules. Those programs will be run off and those displays
            made, which are appropriate to the basic assumptions and their
            stored programming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Another way of looking at the results and at the metaprogramming is
            that we start out with a basic set of beliefs, believe them to be
            "objectively" valid (not just "formally" valid) and do the
            experiments and interpret them with this point of view. If one
            proceeds along these lines, one can quickly reach the end of one's
            ability to interpret the results. One finds that one cannot grasp
            conceptually the phenomena that ensue. With this metatheory, this
            type of experience is not just the computer operating in isolation,
            confinement and solitude on preprogrammed material being elicited
            from memory, but is
            <em
                >really in communication with other beings, and the influence on
                one 's self by them is real.</em
            >
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Thus in this case one is assuming the existence theorem in regard to
            the basic assumptions, i.e., there is objective validity to them
            quite outside of self and one's making the assumptions. This
            epistemological position can also be investigated by these methods.
            This is somewhat the position that was taken by Aldous Huxley and by
            various other groups. For example, pursuit of certain nonWestern
            philosophies as the <em>Ultimate Truth</em> was generated by these
            persons.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One cannot take sides on these two widely diverse epistemological
            bases. On the one hand we have the basic assumptions of the modern
            scientists and on the other hand the basic assumptions of those
            interested in the <em>religious</em> aspect of existence. If one is
            to remain philosophic and objective in this field, one must
            dispassionately survey both of these extreme metatheoretical
            positions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One basic lesson learned from these experiments is that, in general,
            one's preferences for various kinds of metatheoretical positions are
            dictated by considerations other than one's ideals of impartiality,
            objectivity, and a dispassionate view. The metatheoretical position
            held by scientists in general is espoused for purposes of defining
            <em>the truth,</em> for purposes of understanding in their
            particular compartment of science, for acceptance among other
            scientists and for each one's own
            <em>internal security operations</em> with respect to his own
            unconscious programs. It is to be expected that anxiety is
            engendered in some scientists by making the above assumptions
            <em>as if true</em> (even temporarily) in an experimental framework.
            One can easily be panicked by the invasion of the selfmetaprograms
            by automatic <em>existence</em>programs from below the level of
            one's awareness, programs which may strike at the existence of self,
            at the control of self, at the origins of self, at the destinations
            of self, and of the relations of self to a known external reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Possibly one of the <strong>safest</strong> positions to take with
            regard to all of these phenomena is that given in this paper, i.e.,
            the formalistic view in which one makes the assumption that the
            computer itself generates all of the phenomena expe- rienced. This
            is an acceptable assumption of modern science. This is the socalled
            <em>common sense</em> assumption. This is the assumption acceptable
            to one's colleagues in science.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Such considerations, of course, do not touch upon nor prove the
            validity or invalidity of the assumptions nor of the results of the
            experiments. In order to leave this theory openended and to allow
            for the presence of the unknown, it is necessary to take the
            ontological and epistemological position that
            <strong
                >one cannot know as a result of this kind of solitudinous
                experiment whether or not the phenomena are explicable only by
                nonbiocomputer interventions or only by happenings within the
                computer itself, or both.</strong
            >
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            I wish to emphasize that there is a necessity not to espouse
            <em>a truth</em>
            because it is safe.
            <strong
                >Being driven to a set of assumptions because one is afraid of
                another set and their consequences is the most passionate and
                nonobjective kind of philosophy.</strong
            >
            Too many intellectuals and scientists (almost unconsciously) use
            basic assum- ptions as defenses against their fears of other
            assumptions and their consequences. Until we can train ourselves to
            be dispassionate and accept both the assumptions and the results of
            making them without arrogance, without pride, without misplaced
            enthusiasm, without fear, without panic, without anger, hence
            without emotional involvement in the results or in the theories, we
            cannot advance this <em>inner</em> science of Man very far.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Those who wish to embrace the <em>truth</em> of an alternative set
            of assumptions as an escape from the basic assumptions of modern
            science are equally at fault. Those who must find
            <em>a communication with other beings</em> in this kind of
            experiment will <strong>apparently</strong> find it. One must be
            aware that there are (as in the child) needs within one's self for
            finding certain kinds of phenomena and espousing them as the
            ultimate truth. Such childlike needs dictate their own metaprograms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            I am not agreeing with any extreme group in interpreting these
            results. It is convenient for me to assume, as of this time, that
            these phenomena all occurred within the biocomputer. I tend to
            assume that ESP cannot have played a role. At the moment this is the
            position which I find to be most tenable in a logical sense. I do
            not wish to be dogmatic about this. I wish to indicate that this is
            where I stand as of the writing describing this particular stage of
            the work. I await demonstrations of the validity of alternative
            existence theorems.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            If ever good, hardnosed, common sense, unequivocal evidence for the
            existence of currently unaccepted assumptions is presented by those
            who have thoroughly attenuated their childish needs for particular
            beliefs, I hope I am prepared to examine it dispassionately and
            thoroughly. The pitfalls of group interlock are quite as insidious
            as the pitfalls of one's own phantasizing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            <strong
                >Group acceptance of undemonstrated existence theorems and
                of</strong

                >no more validity to the theorems and to the beliefs than one's
                own phantasizing can add. Anaclitic group behavior is no better
                than solitudinous phantasies of</strong
            >
            <em>the truth.</em> Where <em>agreedupon </em>truth can exist in the
            science of the innermost realities is not and cannot yet be settled.
            Beginnings have been made by many men, satisfying proofs by one.
