        <h2>Foreward to Second Editon</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            This work has a curious history. It was written as a final summary
            report to a government agency (National Institute of Mental Health)
            concerning five years of my life work (the agency paid my salary for
            the five years).
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            It was conceived from a space rarer these days than it was then: the
            laws suspending scientific interest, research, involvement and
            decisions about dlysergic acid diethyl amide tartate were passed
            just as this particular work was completed; the researchers were
            inadequately consulted (put down, in fact). The legislators composed
            laws in an atmosphere of desperation. The national negative program
            on LSD was launched; LSD was the big scare, on a par with War,
            Pestilence, and Famine as the destroyer of young brains, minds and
            fetuses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In this atmosphere (1966-1967) Programming and Metaprogramming in
            The Human Biocomputer was written. The work and its notes are dated
            from 1964 to 1966. The conception was formed in 1949, when I was
            first exposed to computer design ideas by Britton Chance. I coupled
            these ideas back to my own software through the atmosphere of my
            neurophysiological research on cerebral cortex. It was more fully
            elaborated in the tank isolation solitude and confinement work at
            NIMH from 1953 to 1958, run in parallel with the neurophysiological
            research on the rewarding and punishing systems in the brain. The
            dolphin research was similarly born in the tank, with brain
            electrode results as parents in the further conceptions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            While I was writing this work, l was a bit too fearful to express
            candidly in writing the direct experience, uninterpreted. I felt
            that a group of thirty persons' salaries, a large research budget, a
            whole Institute's life depended on me and what I wrote. If I wrote
            the data up straight, I would have rocked the boats of several lives
            (colleagues and family) beyond my own stabilizer effectiveness
            threshold, I hypothesized.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Despite my precautionary attitude, the circulation in 1967 of this
            work contributed to the withdrawal of research funds in 1968 from
            the research program on dolphins by one government agency. I heard
            several negative stories regar- ding my brain and mind, altered by
            LSD. At this point I closed the Institute and went to the Maryland
            Psychiatric Research Center to resume LSD research under government
            auspices. I introduced the ideas in work to the MPRC researchers and
            l left for the Esalen Institute in 1969.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            At Esalen my involvement in direct human gut to gut communication
            and lack of involvement in administrative responsibility brought my
            courage to the sticking place. Meanwhile, Stewart Brand of the Whole
            Earth Truck Catalog (Menlo Park, Calif.) reviewed the work in the
            Whole Earth Catalog from a mimeographed copy I had given W. W.
            Harmon of Stanford for his Sufic purposes. Stewart wrote me asking
            for copies to sell. l had 300 printed photo offset from the typed
            copy. He sold them in a few weeks and asked permission to reprint on
            newsprint an enlarged version at a lower price. Skeptical about
            salability, I agreed. Book People, Berkeley, arranged the
            reprinting. Several thousand copies were sold.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            I had written the report in such a way that its basic messages were
            hidden behind a heavy long introduction designed to stop the usual
            reader. Apparently once word got out, this device no longer stalled
            the interested readers. Somehow the basic messages were important
            enough to enough readers so that the work acquired an unexpected
            viability. Thus it seems appropriate to reprint it in full.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            On several different occasions, I have been asked to rewrite this
            work. One such start at rewrite ended up as ano- ther book. (The
            Center of the Cyclone, The Julian Press, Inc., New York, 1972.)
            Another start is evolving into my book number five (Simulations of
            God: A Science of Belief). It seems as if this older work is a
            seminating source for other works and solidly resists revision. To
            me it is a thing separate from me, a record from a past space, a
            doorway into new spaces through which I passed and cannot return.
