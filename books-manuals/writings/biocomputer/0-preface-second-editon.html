        <h2>Preface to the Second Edition</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            All human beings, all persons who reach adulthood in the world today
            are programmed biocomputers. No one of us can escape our own nature
            as programmable entities. Literally, each of us may be our programs,
            nothing more, nothing less.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Despite the great varieties of programs available, most of us have a
            limited set of programs. Some of these are builtin. The structure of
            our nervous system reflects its origins in simpler forms of
            organisms from sessile protozoans, sponges, corals through sea
            worms, reptiles and protomammals to primates to apes to early
            anthropoids to huma- noids to man. In the simpler basic forms, the
            programs were mostly builtin: from genetic codes to fully formed
            orga- nisms adultly reproducing, the patterns of function of
            actionreaction were determined by necessities of survival, of
            adaptation to slow environmental changes, of passing on the code to
            descendants.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As the size and complexity of the nervous system and its bodily
            carrier increased, new levels of programmability appeared, not tied
            to immediate survival and eventual reproduction. The builtin
            programs survived as a basic underlying context for the new levels,
            excitable and inhibitable, by the overlying control systems.
            Eventually, the cerebral cortex appeared as an expanding new
            highlevel computer controlling the structurally lower levels of the
            nervous system, the lower builtin programs. For the first time
            learning and its faster adaptation to a rapidly changing environment
            began to appear. Further, as this new cortex expanded over several
            millions of years, a critical size of cortex was reached. At this
            new level of structure, a new capability emerged: learning to learn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            When one learns to learn, one is making models, using symbols,
            analogizing, making metaphors, in short, inventing and using
            language, mathematics, art, politics, business, etc. At the critical
            brain (cortex) size, languages and its consequences appear.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            To avoid the necessity of repeating learning to learn, symbols,
            metaphors, models each time, I symbolize the under- lying idea in
            these operations as metaprogramming. Metaprogramming appears at a
            critical cortical size-the cerebral computer must have a large
            enough number of interconnected circuits of sufficient quality for
            the operations of meta- programming to exist in that biocomputer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Essentially, metaprogramming is an operation in which a central
            control system controls hundreds of thousands of programs operating
            in parallel simultaneously. This operation in 1972 is not yet done
            in manmade computers- metaprogramming is done outside the big
            solidstate computers by the human programmers, or more properly, the
            human metaprogrammers. All choices and assignments of what the
            solidstate computers do, how they operate, what goes into them are
            still human biocomputer choices. Eventually, we may construct a
            metaprogramming computer, and turn these choices over to it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            When I said we may be our programs, nothing more, nothing less, I
            meant the substrate, the basic substratum under all else, of our
            metaprograms is our programs. All we are as humans is what is
            builtin and what has been acquired, and what we make of both of
            these. So we are one more result of the program substrate-the
            selfmetaprogrammer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            As out of several hundreds of thousands
            <strong>of the substrate</strong> programs comes an adaptable
            changing set of thousands of metaprograms, so out of the
            metaprograms as substrate comes something else-the controller, the
            steersman, the programmer in the biocomputer, the
            selfmetaprogrammer. In a well organized biocomputer, there is at
            least one such critical control metaprogram labeled I for acting on
            other metaprograms and labeled me when acted upon by other
            metaprograms. I say at least one advisedly. Most of us have several
            controllers, selves, selfmetaprograms which divide control among
            them, either in time parallel or in time series in sequences of
            control. As I will give in detail later, one path for
            selfdevelopment is to centralize control of one's biocomputer in one
            selfmetaprogrammer, making the others into conscious executives
            subordinate to the single administrator, the single superconscient
            selfmetaprogrammer. With appropriate methods, this centralizing of
            control, the elementary unification operation, is a realizable state
            for many, if not all biocomputers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Beyond and above in the control hierarchy, the position of this
            single administrative selfmetaprogrammer and his staff, there may be
            other controls and controllers, which, for convenience, I call
            <strong>supraself metaprograms.</strong> These are many or one
            depending on current states of consciousness in the single
            selfmetaprogrammer. These may be perso- nified as if entities,
            treated as if a network for information transfer, or realized as if
            self traveling in the Universe to strange lands or dimensions or
            spaces. If one does a further unification operation on these
            supraself metaprograms, one may arrive at a concept labeled God, the
            Creator, the Starmaker, or whatever. At times we are tempted to pull
            together apparently independent supraself sources as if one. I am
            not sure that we are quite ready to do this supraself unification
            operation and have the result correspond fully to an objective
            reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Certain states of consciousness result from and cause operation of
            this apparent unification phenomenon. We are still general purpose
            computers who can program any conceivable model of the universe
            inside our own structure, reduce the single selfmetaprogrammer to a
            micro size, and program him to travel through his own model as if
            real (level 6, Satori +6: Lilly, 1972). This property is useful when
            one steps outside it and sees it for what it is-an immensely
            satisfying realization of the programmatic power of one's own
            biocomputer. To overvalue or to negate such experiences is not a
            necessary operation. To realize that one has this property is an
            important addition to one's selfmetaprogrammatic list of probables.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Once one has control over modelling the universe inside one's self,
            and is able to vary the parameters satisfactorily, one's self may
            reflect this ability by changing appropriately to match the new
            property.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The quality of one's model of the universe is measured by how well
            it matches the real universe. There is no guarantee that one's
            current model does match the reality, no matter how certain one
            feels about the high quality of the match. Feelings of awe,
            reverence, sacredness and certainty are also adaptable metaprograms,
            attachable to any model, not just the best fitting one.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Modern science knows this: we know that merely because a culture
            generated a cosmology of a certain kind and worshipped with it, was
            no guarantee of goodness of fit with the real universe. In so far as
            they are testable, we now proceed to test (rather than to worship)
            models of the universe. Feelings such as awe and reverence are
            recognized as biocomputer energy sources rather than as determinants
            of truth, i.e., of the goodness of fit of models vs. reali- ties. A
            pervasive feeling of certainty is recognized as a property of a
            state of consciousness, a special space, which may be indicative or
            suggestive but is no longer considered as a final judgement of a
            true fitting. Even as one can travel inside one's models inside
            one's head, so can one travel outside or be the outside of one's
            model of the universe, still inside one's head (see Lilly 1972 level
            or state +3, Satori +3). In this metaprogram it is as if one joins
            the creators, unites with God, etc. Here one can so attenuate the
            self that it may disappear.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One can conceive of other supraself metaprograms farther out than
            these, such as are given in Olaf Stapledon's The Starmaker (Dover,
            New York, 1937). Here the self joins other selves, touring the
            reaches of past and future time and of space, everywhere. The
            planetwide consciousness joins into solar systems consciousness into
            galaxywide consciousness. Intergalactic sharing of consciousness
            fused into the mind of the universe finally faces its creator, the
            Starmaker. The universe's mind realizes that its creator knows its
            imperfections and will tear it down to start over, creating a more
            perfect universe.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Such uses of one's own biocomputer as the above can teach one
            profound truths about one's self, one's capabilities. The resulting
            states of being, of consciousness, teach one the basic truth about
            one's own equipment as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true is true or
            becomes true, within certain limits to be found experientially and
            experimentally. These limits are further beliefs to be transcended.
            In the mind, there are no limits. (Lilly, 1972).
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the province of the mind is the region of one's models, of the
            alone self, of memory, of the metaprograms. What of the region which
            includes one's body, other's bodies? Here there are definite limits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the network of bodies, one's own connected with others for bodily
            survivalprocreationcreation, there is another kind of information:
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            In the province of connected minds, what the network believes to be
            true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits to be
            found experientially and experimentally. These limits are further
            beliefs to be transcended. In the network's mind there are no
            limits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            But, once again, the bodies of the network housing the minds, the
            ground on which they rest, the planet's surface, impose definite
            limits. These limits are to be found experientially and
            experimentally, agreed upon by special minds, and communicated to
            the network. The results are called consensus science.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Thus, so far, we have information without limits in one's mind and
            with agreedupon limits (possibly unnecessary) in a network of minds.
            We also have information within definite limits (to be found) with
            one body and in a network of bodies on a planet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            With this formulation, our scientific problem can be stated very
            succinctly as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Given a single body and a single mind physically isolated and
            confined in a completely physically controlled environ- ment in true
            solitude, by our present sciences can we satisfactorily account for
            all inputs and all outputs to and from this mind- biocomputer (i.e.,
            can we truly isolate and confine it?)? Given the properties of the
            softwaremind of this biocomputer outlined above, is it probable that

            consen- sus science? Does this center of consciousness
            receivetransmit information by at present unknown modes of

            In this book I try to show you where I am in this search and
            research. In previous books I have dealt with personal experiences.
