        <h2>EXPERIMENTS ON BASIC METAPROGRAMS OF EXISTENCE</h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Preliminary to the experiments in changing basic beliefs, many
            experiments with the profound physical isolation and solitude
            situation were carried out over a period of several years. These
            experiences were followed by combining the LSD<sub>25</sub> state
            and the physical isolation state in a second period of several
            years. The minimum time between experiments was thirty days, the
            maximum time several months. [Tables 1, 7 and 8]
        </p>
        <br />
        <!--Basic Belief No. 1-->
        <h2><em>Basic Belief No. 1</em></h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Basic Belief No. 1 was made possible by the early isolation results
            <em
                >Assume that the subject's body and brain can operate
                comfortably isolated without him paying any attention to it.</em
            >
            This belief expresses the faith that one has in one's experience in
            the isolation situation, that one can consciously ignore the
            necessities of breathing and other bodily functions, and that they
            will take care of themselves automatically without detailed
            attention on the part of one's self. This result allowed<strong
                >existence</strong
            >
            metaprograms to be made in relative safety.
        </p>

                >in isolation for periods of twenty minutes to two hours were
                successful</strong
            >
            in sixteen experiments. This success, in turn, allowed other basic
            beliefs to be experimented upon. The basic belief that one could
            <strong><em>leave the body and explore new universes</em></strong>
            was successfully programmed in the first eight different experiments
            lasting from five minutes to forty minutes; the later eight
            experiments were on the
            <em>cognitional multidimensional space</em> without the
            <em>leaving the body</em> metaprogram (see previous section on
            Projection for the <em>cognition space</em> phenomenon).
        </p>
        <br />
        <!--Basic Belief No. 2-->
        <h2><em>Basic Belief No. 2</em></h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The subject <strong>sought</strong>
            <em
                >beings other than himself, not human, in whom he existed and
                who control him and other human beings.</em
            >
            Thus the subject found whole new <em>universes</em> containing great
            varieties of <em>beings,</em> some greater than himself, some equal
            to himself, and some lesser than himself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Those greater than himself were a set which was so huge in spacetime
            as to make the subject feel
            <em
                >as a mere mote in their sunbeam, a single microflash of energy
                in their time scale, my fortyfive years are but an instant in
                their lifetime, a single thought in their vast computer, a mere
                particle in their assemblages of living cognitive units.</em
            >
            He felt he was in the absolute unconscious of these beings. He
            experienced many more sets all so much greater than himself that
            they were almost inconceivable in their complexity, size and time
            scales.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Those <em>beings</em> which were close to the subject in
            complexity-sizetime were dichotomized into the
            <em>evil ones</em> and <em>the good ones.</em> The
            <em>evil</em> ones (subject said) were busy with purposes so foreign
            to his own that he had many nearmisses and almost fatal accidents in
            encounters with them; they were almost totally unaware of his
            existence and hence almost wiped him out, apparently without knowing
            it. The subject says that the <em>good</em> ones
            <em
                >thought good thoughts to him, through him, and to one
                another.</em
            >
            They were at least conceivably human and humane. He interpreted them
            as alien yet <em>friendly.</em> They were not so alien as to be
            completely removed from human beings in regard to their purposes and
            activities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            Some of these beings (the subject reported) are programming us in
            the long term. They nurture us. They experiment on us. They control
            the probability of our discovering and exploiting new science. He
            reports that discoveries such as nuclear energy, LSD<sub>25</sub>,
            RNA, DNA, etc., are under probability control by these beings.
            Further, humans are tested by some of these beings and cared for by
            others. Some of them have programs which include our survival and
            progress. Others have programs which include oppositions to these
            <em>good</em> programs and include our ultimate demise as a species.
            Thus the subject interpreted the evil ones as willing to sacrifice
            us in their experiments; hence they
            <em>are alien and removed from us.</em> The subject reported with
            this set of beliefs that
            <em
                >only limited choices are still available to us as a species. We
                are an ant colony in their laboratory.</em
            >
        </p>
        <br />
        <!--Basic Belief No. 3-->
        <h2><em>Basic Belief No. 3</em></h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            The subject assumed
            <strong
                >the existence of beings in whom humans exist and who directly
                control humans.</strong
            >
            This is a tighter control program than the previous one and assumes
            continuous day and night, second to second, control, as if each
            human being were a cell in a larger organism. Such beings insist
            upon activities in each human being totally under the control of the
            organism of which each human being is a part. In this state there is
            no free will and no freedom for an individual. This
            supraselfmetaprogram was entered twice by the subject; each time he
            had to leave it; for him it was too anxietyprovoking. In the first
            case he
            <em
                >became a part of a vast computer in which he was one element.
                In the second case he was a thought in a much larger mind: being
                modified rapidly, flexibly and plastically.</em
            >
            All of the above experiments were done looking upward in Fig. 1 from
            the selfprogrammer to the supraselfmetaprograms. A converse set of
            experiments was done in which the selfmetan programmer looked
            downward towards the metaprograms, the programs and the lower levels
            of Fig. 1.
        </p>

        <h2><em>Basic Belief No. 4</em></h2>
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            One set of basic beliefs can be subsumed under the directions
            <strong
                ><em
                    >seek those beings whom we control and who exist in us.</em
                ></strong
            >
            With this program the subject found old models in himself (old
            programs, old metaprograms, implanted by others, implanted by self,
            injected by parents, by teachers, etc.). He found that these were
            disparate and separate autonomous <em>beings</em> in himself. He
            described them as a <em>noisy group.</em> His incorporated parents,
            his siblings, his own offspring, his teachers, his wife seemed to be
            a disorganized crowd within him, each running and arguing a program
            with him and in him. While he watched, battles took place between
            these <em>models</em> during the experiment.
            <strong
                >He settled many disparate and nonintegrated points between
                these</strong
            >
            <em>beings</em> and gradually incorporated more of them into the
            selfmetaprogram.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            After many weeks of selfanalysis outside the experimental milieu
            (and some help with his former analyst), it was seen that these
            <em>beings within the self</em> were also those other
            <em>beings outside self</em> of the other experiments. The subject
            described the projected asifoutside beings to be
            <em><strong>cognitional carnivores</strong></em>
            <em
                >attempting to eat up his selfmetaprogram and wrest control from
                him.</em
            >
            As the various levels of metaprograms became straightened out in the
            subject, he was able to categorize and begin to control the various
            levels as they were presented during these experiments. As his
            apparently unconscious needs for credence in these beliefs were
            attenuated with analytic work, his freedom to move from one set of
            basic beliefs to another was increased and the anxiety associated
            with this kind of movement gradually disappeared.
        </p>

        <!-- paragraph-->
        <p>
            A basic overall metaprogram was finally generated: For his own
            intellectual satisfaction
            <strong
                >the subject found that he best assume that all of the phenomena
                that took place existed only in his own brain and in his own
                mind. Other assumptions about the existence of these</strong
            >
            <em>beings</em> had become subjects suitable for research rather
            than subjects for blind (unconscious, conscious) <em>belief</em> for
            this person.

            Experiments also were done upon
            <strong>movements of self forward and back in spacetime.</strong>
            The results showed that when attempting to go
            <em>forward into the future</em> the subject began to
            <em>realize</em> his own goals for that future, and imagine
            <em>wishful thinking solutions</em> to current problems. When he put
            in the metaprogram for going back into his own childhood,
            <em>real and phantasy memories</em> were evoked and integrated. When
            he pushed back through to the <strong>in utero</strong>
            situation,hefoundanearlynightmarewhichwasreinvokedandsolved.Relyingonhisscientific
            <em>knowledge,</em> he pushed the program back through previous
            generations, prehuman primates, carnivores, fish and protozoa. He
            experienced a s<em>perm-egg explosion</em> on the way through this
            past <em>reinvocation</em> of <em>imaginary</em> experience.

            The last set of experiments (see
            <strong>Use of Projection</strong> section) was made possible by the
            results of the previous set. Progress in controlling the projection
            metaprogram resulted from the <em>other universes</em> experiments.
            Finally the subject understood and had become familiar with his need
            for <em>phantasied other universes.</em> Analytic work allowed him
            to bypass this need and penetrate into the
            <em>cognitional multidimensional projection spaces.</em>
            <strong>Experiments in programming in this</strong>
            <em>innermost space</em> showed results quite satisfying to a high
            degree of credence in the belief that all experiments in the series
            showed inner happenings without needing the
            <em>participation of outer causes.</em> The need for the constant
            use of <em>outer causes</em> was found to be a projected outward
            metaprogram to avoid taking personal respon- sibility for portions
            of the contents of his own mind. His dislike for certain kinds of
            his own nonsensical programs caused him to project them and thus

            In summation, the subjectively apparent results of the experiments
            were to straighten out a good deal of the "nonsense" in this
            subject's computer. Through these experiments he was able to examine
            some <em>wardedoff beliefs and defensive structures</em> accumulated
            throughout his life. The net result was a feeling of greater
            integration of self and a feeling of positive affect for the current
            structure of himself, combined with an improved skepticism of the
            validity of subjective judging of events in self.

            Some <em>objective</em> testing of these essentially subjective
            judgments have been initiated through cooperation with other
            persons. Such objective testing is very difficult; this area needs a
            great deal of future research work. We need better investigative
            techniques, combining subjective and behavioral (verbal) techniques.
            The major feeling that one has after such experiences and
            experiments is that the fluidity and plasticity of one's computer
            has certain limits to it, and that those limits have been enlarged
            somewhat by the experiments. How long such enlargement lasts and to
            what extent are still not known of course. A certain amount of
            continued critical skepticism about and in the selfmetapro- gram
            (and in its <em>felt</em> changes) is very necessary for a scientist
            exploring these areas.
