            "The general (purpose) computer is... a machine in which the
            operator can prescribe, for any internal state of the machine and
            for any given condition affecting it, what state it shall go to
            next... All behaviors are at the operator's disposal. A program...
            with the machine forms a mechanism that will show (any thinkable)
            behavior. This generalization has largely solved the main problem of
            the brain so far as its objective behavior is concerned; the nature
            of its subjective aspects may be left to the next generation, if
            only to reassure them that there are still major scientific worlds
            left to conquer." (W. Ross Ashby, "What Is Mind?" in Theories of the

            The relations of the activities of the brain to the subjective life
            in the mind have long been an arguable puzzle. In this century some
            advances in the reciprocal fields of study of each aspect of the
            question apparently can begin to clear up some of the dilemmas. This
            is a report of a theory and its use which is intended to attempt to
            link operationally, the:

        <p>The basic assumptions are as follows:</p>
        <br />
        <!-- Ordered List with Paragraphs-->
        <ol>
            <!-- ONE -->
            <li>
                <p>
                    The human brain is assumed to be an immense biocomputer,
                    several thousands of times larger than any constructed by
                    Man from nonbiological components by 1965.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The numbers of neurons in the human brain are variously
                    estimated at 13 billions (1.3 times ten to the tenth) with
                    approximately five times that many glial cells. This
                    computer operates continuously throughout all of its parts
                    and does literally millions of computations in parallel
                    simultaneously. It has approximately two million visual
                    inputs and one hundred thousand acoustic inputs. It is hard
                    to compare the operations of such a magnificent computer to
                    any artificial ones existing today because of its very
                    advanced and sophisticated construction.

                    Certain properties of this computer are known, others are
                    yet to be found. One of these properties obviously is a very
                    large memory storage. Another is control over hundreds of
                    thousands of outputs in a coordinated and programmed
                    fashion. Other examples are the storage and evocation of all
                    those complex behaviors and perceptions known as speech,
                    hearing and language. Some of the more unusual properties of
                    this computer are given further along in this paper.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Certain programs are builtin, within the difficult-to-modify
                    parts of the (macro and micro) structure of the brain
                    itself. At the lowest possible level such programs which are
                    builtin are those of feeding, eating, sex, avoidance and
                    approach programs, certain kinds of fears, pains, etc.

                <p>
                    Programs vary in their permanence, some are apparently
                    evanescent and erasable, others operate without apparent
                    change for tens of years. Among the evanescent and erasable
                    programs one might categorize the ability to use visual
                    projection in the service of one's own thinking. One finds
                    this ability with a very high incidence among children and a
                    very low incidence among adults. An example of a program
                    operating without change for tens of years one can show
                    handwriting, over a long series of years, to maintain its
                    own unique patterns.

                <p>
                    Programs are acquirable throughout life. Apparently no
                    matter how old a person is, there is still a possibility of
                    acquiring new habits. The difficulties of acquisition may
                    increase with age, however, it is not too sure that this is
                    correct. The problem may not be with acquiring programs so
                    much as a decrease in the motivation for acquiring programs.

                    The young newly growing computer acquires programs as its
                    structure expands some of these take on the appearance of
                    builtin permanence. An example of such acquisition of
                    programs in a child is in the pronunciation of words. Once
                    it agrees with those of the parents the pronunciation is
                    very difficult to change later, i.e., there is really no
                    great motivation for the child to change a particular
                    pronunciation when it is satisfactory to those who listen.

                    Some of the programs of the young growing computer are in
                    the inherited genetic code; how these become active and to
                    what extent is known only in a few biochemical-behavioral
                    cases, at variance with the expectable and usual patterns of
                    development. The socalled Mongoloid phenomenon is inherited
                    and develops at definite times in the individual's life.
                    There are several other interesting clinical entities which
                    appear to be genetically determined. To elicit the full
                    potential of the young growing computer requires special
                    environments to avoid negative antigrowth kinds of programs
                    being inserted in the young computer early.

                <p>
                    The inherited genetic programs place the upper and the lower
                    bounds on the total real performance and on the potential
                    performance of the computer at each instant of its life
                    span. Once again we are assuming that the best environment
                    is presented to the young organism at each part of its life
                    span. It is not meant to imply that such an environment
                    currently is being achieved. This basic assumption seems
                    highly probable but would be very difficult to test.

                    The major problems of the research which are of interest to
                    the author center on the erasability, modifiability, and
                    creatability of programs. In other words, I am interested in
                    the processes of finding metaprograms (and methods and
                    substances) which control, change, and create the basic
                    metaprograms of the human computer. It is not known whether
                    one can really erase any program. Conflicting schools of
                    thought go from the extremes that
                    <em
                        >one stores everything within the computer and never
                        erases it</em
                    >
                    to

                        >only the important aspects and functions are stored in
                        the computer</em
                    >
                    and hence, there is no problem of erasing. Modifications of
                    already existing programs can be done with more or less
                    success. The creation of new programs is a difficult
                    assignment. How can one recognize a new program once it is
                    created? This new program may merely be a variation on
                    already stored programs.

                    To date some of the metaprograms are unsatisfactory
                    (educational methods for the very young, for example). It is
                    doubtful if any metaprogram is fully satisfactory to the
                    inquiring mind. Some are assumed to be provisionally
                    satisfactory for current heuristic reasons. To keep an open
                    mind and at the same time a firm enough belief in certain
                    essential metaprograms is not easy; in a sense we are all
                    victims of the previous metaprograms which have been laid
                    down by other humans long before us.

                    The human computer has general purpose properties within its
                    limits. The definition of general purpose implies the
                    ability to attack problems that differ not only in
                    quantitative degree of complexity but also that differ
                    qualitatively in the levels of abstraction in the content
                    dealt with. One can shift rapidly one's mind and its
                    attention from one area of human activity to another with
                    very little delay in the reprogramming of one's self to the
                    new activity. The broader the front of such reprogramming
                    the more general purpose the computer is. The ability to
                    move from the interhuman business world to the laboratory
                    world of the scientist would be an example of a fairly
                    general purpose computer.

                    not imply that the whole computer can bethought of as

                    The older classifications of fields of human endeavor and of
                    science are redefinable with this view of the human brain
                    and the human mind. For example, the term suggestibility has
                    often been used in a limited context of programming and of
                    being programmed by someone outside. Hypnotic phenomena are
                    seen when a given computer allows itself to be more or less
                    completely programmed by another one. Metaprogramming is
                    considered a more inclusive term than suggestibility.
                    Metaprogramming considers sources, inputs, outputs, and
                    central processes rather than just the end result of the
                    process (see Fig. 1). Suggestibility names only the property
                    of receiving orders and carrying them out rather than
                    considering the sources, inputs, outputs, and central
                    processes (ref. H. Bernheim, Clark Hull).

                    terminology, the mind includes unconscious and instinctual
                    programs.) This definition and basic assumption has various

                    There is in certain fields of human thinking and endeavor, a
                    necessity to have a third entity, sometimes including,
                    sometimes not needing the brain-mind-computer; commonly this
                    entity is defined as existing by theologians and other
                    persons interested in religion. Whether the term "spirit" or
                    "soul" or other is used is immaterial in this framework.
                    Such terms inevitably come up in the discussion of the
                    ultimate meanings of existence, the origins of the brainmind
                    computers, the termination or the destinations of self after
                    bodily death, and the existence or non- existence of minds
                    greater than ours, within or outside of braincomputers. This
                    extra-brain-mind-computer entity can be included in this
                    theory if and when needed. (I agree that such assumptions
                    may be needed to give overall meaning to the whole of Man.
                    Religion is an area for experimental science. Work starts in
                    this area with the basic assumptions of William James, the
                    great psychologist. The definitions in this area of this
                    theory may be expanded in the future. Some compound term
                    like "brain-mind-spirit-computer may be developed at that
                    time). There is still the problem of the existence theorem
                    to be satisfied in regard to this third entity. There are
                    some persons who assume it exists; there are others who
                    assume it does not exist.

                    connotations; all of this area should be subjected to
                    careful reevaluation with the new view in mind. Applications

                    For substances like ethyl alcohol the term

                    Some kinds of material evoked from storage seem to have the
                    property of passing back in time beyond the beginning of
                    this brain to previous brains at their same stage of
                    development; there seems to be a passing of specific
                    information from past organisms through the genetic code to
                    the present organism; but, again, this idea may be a
                    convenient evasion, avoiding deeper analysis of self. One
                    cannot make this assumption that storage in memory goes back
                    beyond the spermegg combination or even to the spermegg
                    combination until a wishful phantasy cons- tructed to avoid

                    The fact of various CNS circuits existing as reward and as
                    "punishment" systems when stimulated by artificial or by
                    natural inputs must be taken into account (Lilly, J. C.,
                    1957, 1958, 1959). The powerful emotional underpinnings of
                    "movement toward" and "movement away" must be included, as
                    well as the acquisition of code symbols for these processes.
                    Such symbols tend to set up the priority hierarchies of
                    basic operational programs in microformat (nonverbal) and in
                    macroformat (verbal). Too often, "accidental" juxtaposition
                    seems to key off improper hierarchical relations at the
                    outset, with resulting priorities set by "first occurrence"
                    spontaneous configurations, un-planned and unprepared. With
                    a new view and a new approach, with planned "spontaneities"
                    graded by order of occurrence, proper program priorities
                    could be set at the beginning of the computer's life
                    history. The maintenance of general purpose properties from
                    the early human years to adulthood is a worthwhile
                    metaprogram.

                    To hold and to display the accepted view of reality in all
                    its detail and at the same time to program another state of
                    consciousness is difficult; there just isn't enough human
                    brain circuitry to do both jobs in detail perfectly.
                    Therefore special conditions give the best use of the whole
                    computer for exploring, displaying, and fully experiencing
                    new states of consciousness; physical isolation (only with
                    special limited stimulation patterns, if any) (Lilly, 1956)
                    gives the fullest and most complete experiences of the
                    internal explorations. One such extreme condition is
                    profound physical isolation (isothermicity, zerolevel
                    visible quanta, sonic levels below threshold, minimum
                    gravitational resisting unit area forces, minimum internal
                    stimulation intensity, minimum respiration stimulus level,
                    etc.). This condition can give some additional new states of
                    consciousness the "necessary lowlevel evenness of context"
                    in which to develop. These results are facilitated by
                    minimizing the necessities for computing the present demands
                    of the physical reality and its calculable present

                    example, a large amount of hallucinating would not be
                    permissible in our present society. If a person is actively
                    projecting visual images in three dimensions from his stored
                    programs, he may not have enough of his brain functioning in
                    ordinary modes to take care of him with regard to say,
                    gravity, automobiles, and similar hazards. He may become so
                    involved in the projection in the visual field that the
                    inputs from reality itself have to be sacrificed and their
                    quality reduced. It is apparently this danger which teaches
                    us to inhibit hallucinations(i.e., visual projection

                    the above methods illustrate some useful principles to be

                    of the above ones. Such new systematizations are needed; the
                    principles in this theory may be useful in setting them up
                    at each and every level of functioning of the computer.
