        <h1>If you have taken your first trip and have questions about your experience <br>
            I would reccomend starting here</h1>
        <p>The experiences you have just had may have been startling, confusing, blissful, erotic, or seeminly divine. 
            Attempting to put into words the electrical and chemical languages your body has just spoken in an electric-erotic images
            swirl may be extremely difficult. <br>
        </p>
        <p>There is a popular thread of thinking and experiencing to relate these experiences to mystical or spiritual matters
            . When viewed through the filter of spirituality it takes away from the molecule interacting with your nervous system 
            and the amazing and complex reality of what is going on within you. We are immensely complex organisms and you have
            just had a dive through the many canals and tunnels of your nervous wiring. The cones and rods in your eye and the synaptic
            play constantly happening. 
        </p><br>
        <p>These books will help you gain a clear understanding of what you have gone through as a biological/mental/physicsl organism. 
            As a nervous system and as a chemical robot. There are other books that will aid but I believe these may be the most benefical 
            in aiding the understanding of what you have jjust gone through. 
        </p>
        <p>These are not spirital manuals or how to have a pleasing experience neccessarily. These are manuals on what the experience 
            has to offer, what you are as a nervous system, what you are accessing and how to reprogram or reimprint yourself 
            as an organism. 
        </p>
